Since I'm not familiar with programming, I can't clearly answer any of your questions. Just make every determination by yourself about that, filling the gaps as best you can, and just show me the final analysis report.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n# **Community Platform — Product Requirements**\r\n\r\n## **1. Service Overview**\r\n\r\n- A service where users can create **topic-based sub-communities**, post within them, and discuss via comments and **upvotes/downvotes like Reddit.**\r\n- On the **home (/**) main content area**, show **posts from sub-communities I’ve joined**, sorted by the selected **sort order**.\r\n- On the **right sidebar of Home**, always show the **latest posts from all sub-communities**.\r\n- **Every page** has a fixed **left sidebar** with **Home / Explore / Create** buttons and a **Recent Communities** list.\r\n- For **users who haven’t joined any community yet**, the home feed shows **latest or top posts across all communities**, along with **guidance to explore/join communities** at the top or in the right sidebar.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **2. Core Principles**\r\n\r\n1. **Reading is open to everyone.** **Posting, commenting, voting, creating sub-communities, and joining/leaving** require login.\r\n2. Keep the **login session generously long**. When it expires, **prompt a smooth re-login** without interrupting the current screen.\r\n3. **Ownership is account-based.** Users can edit or delete **only the posts/comments they authored**.\r\n4. **Minimize validation** and prioritize **smooth, error-free user flows** and UI behavior.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **3. Major Features**\r\n\r\n### **3.1 Sub-Communities**\r\n\r\n- **Name**: Recommend short, readable alphanumeric names; allow hyphen (-) and underscore (_). **Names must be unique.**\r\n- **Description**: Optional summary of the community.\r\n- **Logo/Banner**: Display if provided (fallback to a default image).\r\n- **Rules**: Keep brief, numbered if needed.\r\n- **Create**: Any logged-in user can create (only check name uniqueness and basic format).\r\n- **Edit**: Only the creator can edit title/description/logo/banner/rules. **Name is immutable.**\r\n- **Member Count** = number of users who have joined (for display).\r\n- **Category**: Choose 1 from: [Tech & Programming] [Science] [Movies & TV] [Games] [Sports] [Lifestyle & Wellness] [Study & Education] [Art & Design] [Business & Finance] [News & Current Affairs]\r\n- **Delete**: Deleting a sub-community removes all posts within it.\r\n\r\n### **3.1.a Join / Leave**\r\n\r\n- Use the **top-level button** on the community page to toggle between **“Join” ↔ “Joined.”**\r\n- **Effects**\r\n    - The community’s posts are **included in** or **excluded from** the **home main feed**.\r\n    - The **left sidebar’s Recent Communities list** (up to 5, by most recent activity) updates immediately.\r\n    - Joining is unrelated to moderation privileges; it’s purely for **personalized display** (no mod/admin rights granted).\r\n\r\n### **3.2 Posts**\r\n\r\n- **Type**: Text-only (title + body).\r\n- **Composition rules**\r\n    - **Selecting a target sub-community is required.**\r\n    - **Title**: 5–120 characters.\r\n    - **Body**: 10-10,000 characters. Plain text and line breaks only (scripts/code prohibited).\r\n    - **Author display name**: Optional (if empty, use a default like “Anonymous”).\r\n- **Card display fields**: Community name (e.g., /c/ai), title, author, created time, comment count, score (upvotes − downvotes).\r\n- **Permissions**: **Only the author** can edit/delete their post. **Posting does not require membership** in the target community.\r\n\r\n### **3.3 Comments**\r\n\r\n- **Create/Edit/Delete** require login, and **only the author** may edit/delete their comments.\r\n- **Length**: 2-2,000 characters.\r\n- **Structure**: Supports reply threads (nested replies).\r\n\r\n### **3.4 Voting**\r\n\r\n- **One user has a single state per item (post/comment)**:\r\n    - “None” → can switch to **Upvote** or **Downvote**.\r\n    - **Upvote ↔ Downvote** can be toggled directly.\r\n    - Pressing the same button again reverts to **None**.\r\n- **Score** is calculated as **upvotes − downvotes**.\r\n- **Users cannot vote on their own posts/comments.**\r\n\r\n### **3.5 Sorting & Pagination (Clear Rules)**\r\n\r\n- **Sort orders**\r\n    - **Newest**: **Most recently created items first.**\r\n        - If created times are equal, **the more recently generated item (larger identifier)** comes first.\r\n    - **Top**: **Higher score first.**\r\n        - If scores are equal, **more recent creation time** comes first.\r\n        - If created times are also equal, **the more recently generated item (larger identifier)** comes first.\r\n- **Pagination**\r\n    - **Main feeds** (Home, Community Home): **Show 20 cards at a time**; **[Load more]** reveals the next 20.\r\n    - **Right sidebar Global Latest** (sitewide latest posts): **Always show 10** items.\r\n\r\n### **3.6 Search**\r\n\r\n- **Post search**: Match words in title/body. **Query must be at least 2 characters**. **Default sort is Newest**.\r\n- **Sub-community search**: By name/title (query ≥ 2 chars).\r\n- **Comment search**: Sorted by Newest.\r\n- **Results are shown 20 per page**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **4. Information Architecture & Layout**\r\n\r\n### **4.1 Global Layout (All Pages)**\r\n\r\n- **Left Sidebar (fixed)**\r\n    - **Home** button → home feed.\r\n    - **Explore** button → community discovery.\r\n    - **Create** button → create sub-community.\r\n    - **Recent Communities**: **Up to 5 I recently visited or interacted with**, ordered by **most recent activity**. Each shows the community name and a small icon (if absent, show a default), linking to that community’s home.\r\n- **Main Content Area**: Shows the page’s primary content.\r\n- **Right Sidebar**: Shows page-specific secondary info.\r\n    - **Home**: Always shows **Global Latest** (sitewide latest posts).\r\n    - **Community Home/Post Detail**: Shows **Community Info + Rules** box (details below).\r\n\r\n### **4.2 Sitemap**\r\n\r\n```\r\n[HOME] /                         — Unified feed (prioritizes joined communities)\r\n ├─ /submit                      — Global post composer (choose community, login required)\r\n ├─ /s                           — Global search (sub-communities / posts / comments)\r\n ├─ /c                           — Explore sub-communities\r\n │   ├─ /c/create                — Create a sub-community (login required)\r\n │   ├─ /c/[name]                — Specific sub-community home\r\n │   │   ├─ /c/[name]/submit     — Post directly to this community (login required)\r\n │   │   └─ /c/[name]/[postID]   — Post detail + comments\r\n └─ /login                       — Login (modal; overlays on any screen)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **4.3 Screens (by Page)**\r\n\r\n### **A) Home**\r\n\r\n/\r\n\r\n- **Left Sidebar (global)**\r\n    - Home / Explore / Create buttons\r\n    - Recent Communities (up to 5, by most recent activity)\r\n- **Navbar (global)**\r\n    - Logo (to Home) / global search / **Create (post)** button / Profile (dropdown, logout)\r\n- **Main Content**\r\n    - **Sort control** at top: **Dropdown ([Newest] | [Top])**\r\n        - **Behavior**:\r\n            - [Newest] applies the Newest rules from 3.5\r\n            - [Top] applies the Top rules from 3.5\r\n    - **List: 20 post cards from communities I’ve joined** → **[Load more]** adds 20 more\r\n    - Card fields: community name, title, author, time (**relative**), comment count, score (upvotes − downvotes)\r\n    - If an unauthenticated user attempts to post/comment/vote, show login prompt → after login, return to the original action\r\n- **Right Sidebar — Global Latest**\r\n    - **Header label**: “Global Latest”\r\n    - **Content**: **10 most recently posted items across all communities**.

Key requirements: read access is open to everyone; posting, commenting, voting, creating communities, and joining/leaving require login. Ownership is account-based—users can only edit/delete their own content. Home feed shows posts from joined communities sorted by Newest or Top. Right sidebar always shows 10 latest posts from all communities. Left sidebar permanently shows Home/Explore/Create buttons and Recent Communities (up to 5, ordered by most recent activity). Unjoined users see global latest or top posts with guidance to explore communities. Sub-communities have unique alphanumeric names with hyphen/underscore support, optional logo/banner/description/rules, and one category from predefined list. Join/Leave toggles membership status, affecting feed inclusion and Recent Communities list. Posts are text-only with title (5–120 chars) and body (10–10,000 chars), require community selection, and allow optional author display name. Comments support nesting, 2–2,000 chars, editable only by author. Voting allows single state per item: None, Upvote, or Downvote; toggles directly, no self-voting allowed. Sorting: Newest (by creation time then ID) and Top (by score then creation time then ID). Pagination: 20 items per page in main feeds, 10 in global latest sidebar. Search supports posts, communities, and comments (min 2 chars), 20 results per page. Layout includes global left sidebar, top navbar with search and profile, and context-aware right sidebar.

Unlike centralized social media platforms, this service emphasizes organic community formation, user-driven content discovery, and decentralized moderation through collective upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. The platform's core innovation lies in its ability to surface quality content through peer validation rather than algorithmic amplification, creating a more authentic and sustainable discussion environment.\n\n## Business Model\n\n### Why This Service Exists\n\nThe modern digital information landscape is characterized by content saturation, algorithmic bias, and declining trust in centralized platforms. Users increasingly crave spaces where they can engage with niche topics without interference from profit-driven feeds or echo chambers. This service fills a critical market gap by providing a Reddit-like experience optimized for clarity, user autonomy, and community self-governance. Unlike competing platforms that prioritize engagement metrics over content quality or impose monetization structures that compromise user experience, this platform places control firmly in the hands of its users.\n\nThe primary market opportunity exists among knowledge workers, lifelong learners, hobbyists, and creative professionals who seek authentic peer-to-peer knowledge sharing without corporate surveillance or manipulative UI patterns. Competitors such as Reddit, Discord, and niche forums provide partial solutions but suffer from inconsistent user experiences, poor discovery mechanisms, or overly complex moderation tools. This platform differentiates itself by offering a cohesive, intuitive, and highly performant interface with built-in community-building tools that require no technical expertise to use.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n\nThe service operates as a freemium model with zero advertising. Revenue is generated through voluntary micro-donations and optional premium membership features:\n\n- **Micro-donations**: Users can send small monetary contributions to community curators, exceptional content creators, or entire communities they value. Donations are processed through secure third-party payment providers with 100% of proceeds flowing to recipients.\n- **Premium Membership (optional)**: A subscription tier provides enhanced discovery tools, advanced community analytics, early access to new features, and the ability to customize community appearance with proprietary themes and layout options. Premium features are entirely optional and do not affect content visibility or algorithmic sorting.\n\nThe platform is structured to require no advertising, affiliate marketing, or data monetization to remain financially sustainable. This reinforces the core value proposition of user privacy and autonomy.\n\n### Growth Plan\n\nUser acquisition will be driven through five primary channels:\n\n1. **Community Seed Networks**: Early adopters in key interest areas (Tech, Science, Art) will be invited to establish foundational communities that serve as anchors in the network.\n2. **Referral Incentives**: Users who invite others who then join and engage with communities will receive enhanced community visibility badges.\n3. **Content Cross-Promotion**: The globally visible “Latest Posts” sidebar creates organic traffic between communities, encouraging cross-pollination of audiences.\n4. **Search Engine Optimization**: Content within communities is designed to be naturally indexable, making expert discussions discoverable via search engines.\n5. **Integration with Knowledge Platforms**: Partnerships with academic institutions, open-source projects, and educational resources to embed community links in content repositories.\n\nUser retention will be driven by habit formation through the “Recent Communities” sidebar, daily personalized content discovery, and the psychological reward of meaningful community interaction.\n\n### Success Metrics\n\nThe following key performance indicators will be tracked to measure success:\n\n- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Target 50,000 within 12 months\n- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Target 250,000 within 18 months\n- **Average Sessions per User**: Average of 4.5 sessions per day (reinforcing habit formation)\n- **Community Creation Rate**: 500+ new communities created per week\n- **Content Engagement Rate**: Average of 8.3 comments per top post\n- **Donation Conversion Rate**: 8% of registered users make at least one micro-donation annually\n- **Retention Rate (30-day)**: 45% of new users return after 30 days\n- **Community Longevity**: 70% of created communities remain active after 90 days\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Reading is open to everyone.** All content is accessible to unauthenticated users. Posting, commenting, voting, creating sub-communities, and joining/leaving communities require authentication.\n2. **Keep the login session generously long.** When a session expires, the system SHALL prompt the user for re-authentication without interrupting the current screen or navigation context.\n3. **Ownership is account-based.** Users MAY edit or delete only posts or comments they authored. Ownership is determined through authenticated user identifier matching in the backend.\n4. **Minimize validation and prioritize smooth, error-free user flows and UI behavior.** The system SHALL use optimistic UI updates for all user actions, presenting immediate feedback before backend synchronization.\n\n## Major Features\n\n### Sub-Communities\n\n- **Name**: Community names SHALL be short, readable alphanumeric strings that MAY include hyphens (-) and underscores (_). Names SHALL be unique across the entire system.\n- **Description**: A optional summary text field with a maximum length of 500 characters.\n- **Logo/Banner**: Community MAY have an optional logo (PNG, JPG, SVG) and banner (PNG, JPG) image. If not provided, the system SHALL display a default placeholder image.\n- **Rules**: Optional rules in text form, with a maximum of 20 rules permitted. The system SHALL display only the top 5 rules on community pages with numbering (1., 2., 3., etc.).\n- **Create**: When a member clicks the Create button, THE system SHALL validate the community name against uniqueness and format constraints before creation. Creation SHALL be permitted for any authenticated user with member role.\n- **Edit**: Only the original creator of the community SHALL be permitted to edit its description, logo, banner, or rules. The community name SHALL be immutable after creation.\n- **Member Count**: The system SHALL display the real-time count of users who have joined the community. The count SHALL be decreased when a user leaves the community and increased when a user joins.

All system operations are governed by user role permissions, which are enforced at the application layer based on session authentication tokens (JWT). The system operates on three distinct user roles: guest, member, and admin. Authentication is handled through a modal login interface that persists temporarily when sessions expire, allowing seamless restoration of interrupted user flows. Upon successful login, a JWT is issued with a 30-minute expiration for access and a 30-day expiration for refresh tokens. Both tokens are stored client-side in localStorage for convenient access during interactive sessions. The JWT payload includes the user's ID, role, and a permissions array for rapid authorization decisions. All operations require server-side validation of the JWT signature and expiration before any business logic is processed.\n\n## Guest Role Permissions\n\nGuests are unauthenticated users who can view all public content without restriction.\n\nWHEN a user accesses the platform without a valid authentication token, THE system SHALL grant access as a guest.\n\nWHEN a guest views the home feed, THE system SHALL display all posts from all communities based on the selected sort order (Newest or Top).\n\nWHEN a guest searches for content, THE system SHALL return search results for posts, communities, and comments.\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to access any action requiring authentication, THE system SHALL display \"Please sign in to continue.\" and prevent the action from proceeding.\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to create a community, THE system SHALL deny access and display \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to join or leave a community, THE system SHALL deny access and display \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to create a post, THE system SHALL deny access and display \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to post a comment, THE system SHALL deny access and display \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to upvote or downvote any content, THE system SHALL deny access and display \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to edit or delete any post or comment, THE system SHALL hide edit/delete controls and display \"You can edit or delete only items you authored.\"\n\nWHEN a guest visits a community page, THE system SHALL display the community's rules and description without the \"Join\" button.\n\n## Member Role Permissions\n\nMembers are authenticated users who have created an account and successfully logged in. Members can participate actively in the community by creating content, engaging with others, and managing personal community membership.\n\nWHEN a user successfully logs in, THE system SHALL elevate their permissions to member role.\n\nWHEN a member views their home feed, THE system SHALL display posts only from communities they have joined, sorted by the selected criteria (Newest or Top).\n\nWHEN a member attempts to join a community, THE system SHALL update their member profile to include that community in their joined communities list and immediately reflect this change in the home feed and Recent Communities list.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to leave a community, THE system SHALL remove that community from their joined communities list and immediately remove its posts from their home feed while retaining its appearance in Recent Communities if it was last active within the top 5 positions.\n\nWHEN a member creates a post, THE system SHALL associate the post with their user ID and store the optional author display name they provided, defaulting to \"Anonymous\" if none was specified.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to edit their own post, THE system SHALL allow modification of the title and body within character limits (title: 5-120, body: 10-10,000) and preserve the community association.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to delete their own post, THE system SHALL remove the post and all associated comments, and update community post counts accordingly.\n\nWHEN a member creates a comment, THE system SHALL associate the comment with their user ID and store it in the thread, respecting the 2-2,000 character limit.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to update their own comment, THE system SHALL permit edits within the character limit and track version history if implemented in the future.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to delete their own comment, THE system SHALL remove the comment and update the parent post's comment count.\n\nWHEN a member upvotes or downvotes a post or comment, THE system SHALL not allow voting on their own content and shall update the score immediately in the UI before syncing with the server.\n\nWHEN a member clicks the same vote button a second time, THE system SHALL revert their vote state to \"None\" and update the score accordingly.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to vote on their own content, THE system SHALL display \"You can't vote on your own posts/comments.\" and prevent the vote from being registered.\n\nWHEN a member creates a community, THE system SHALL validate the community name for uniqueness and adherence to format rules (alphanumeric with hyphens and underscores only), then create the community with the provided metadata, setting the member as the creator.\n\nWHEN a member edits a community they created, THE system SHALL permit changes to the description, logo, banner, and rules, but SHALL prevent any modification to the immutable community name.\n\n## Admin Role Permissions\n\nAdmins are privileged members with full system oversight capabilities. Administrators can moderate content, manage communities, and handle user reports.\n\nWHEN a user is granted admin privileges by system configuration, THE system SHALL enable additional permissions beyond those of the member role.\n\nWHEN an admin deletes a community, THE system SHALL remove all associated posts and comments and update user joined community lists where applicable.\n\nWHEN an admin attempts to edit any post or comment regardless of authorship, THE system SHALL permit modification or deletion of any content.\n\nWHEN an admin attempts to delete any user's post or comment, THE system SHALL allow immediate removal and bypass ownership restrictions.\n\nWHEN an admin joins or leaves a community, THE system SHALL update their membership status per normal member procedures, but SHALL ignore any restrictions based on the creator status of the community.\n\nWHEN an admin upvotes or downvotes any content, THE system SHALL permit voting on items authored by themselves without restriction.\n\nWHEN an admin attempts to view a community with excessive reported content or flagrant rule violations, THE system SHALL provide additional moderation controls not visible to members.\n\n## Permission Matrix Summary\n\n| Action | Guest | Member | Admin |\n|--------|-------|--------|-------|\n| View Home Feed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View Global Latest (sidebar) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View Community Pages | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View Post Details | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View Search Results | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Create Community | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Edit Community (Title/Description/Logo/Rules) | ❌ | ✅ (Own only) | ✅ (Any) |\n| Delete Community | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Join Community | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Leave Community | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Create Post | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Edit Post | ❌ | ✅ (Own only) | ✅ (Any) |\n| Delete Post | ❌ | ✅ (Own only) | ✅ (Any) |\n| Comment on Post | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Edit Comment | ❌ | ✅ (Own only) | ✅ (Any) |\n| Delete Comment | ❌ | ✅ (Own only) | ✅ (Any) |\n| Upvote Content | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Downvote Content | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Vote on Own Content | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Toggle Vote State | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View Recent Communities | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Access Global Search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Access Create Post | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Access Community Creation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

Ownership of content is strictly account-based, ensuring users retain control over their contributions. Sessions are maintained generously to ensure uninterrupted user experience, and failed authentication during actions is handled by prompting seamless re-login to resume the original intent.\n\nTHE system SHALL enable community-driven content discovery, participation, and moderation through structured sub-communities with reputation-based content ordering.\n\nWHEN a user accesses the platform, THE system SHALL differentiate between authenticated and unauthenticated users in all interface behaviors, data access, and action permissions.\n\nWHILE a user session is active, THE system SHALL preserve the user's authentication state and maintain session continuity until explicit logout or expiration.\n\nWHEN a user session expires, THE system SHALL trigger a non-modal, unobtrusive re-authentication prompt that allows the user to resume their prior action without losing context.\n\nTHE system SHALL apply consistent content ownership rules: users MAY edit or delete only content they authored, regardless of community membership or moderation status.\n\n## Home Feed Requirements\n\nTHE system SHALL display the main home feed (at /) as a unified stream of posts from sub-communities that the authenticated user has joined.\n\nWHEN a user has not joined any sub-community, THE system SHALL display the most recently created or highest-scoring posts from all public sub-communities.\n\nWHEN a user has not joined any sub-community, THE system SHALL display a contextual message or guidance prompt in the main feed area encouraging exploration and joining of communities.\n\nWHEN the user selects a sort order, THE system SHALL reorder the main feed according to the specified criteria:\n\n- WHEN the selected sort order is \"Newest\", THE system SHALL sort posts by creation timestamp in descending order (most recent first)\n- WHERE creation timestamps are identical, THE system SHALL sort posts by internal identifier in descending order (larger ID comes first)\n\n- WHEN the selected sort order is \"Top\", THE system SHALL sort posts by calculated score (upvotes - downvotes) in descending order (highest score first)\n- WHERE scores are equal, THE system SHALL sort posts by creation timestamp in descending order (most recent first)\n- WHERE creation timestamps are also equal, THE system SHALL sort posts by internal identifier in descending order (larger ID comes first)\n\nTHE system SHALL paginate the main feed in pages of 20 post cards per page.\n\nWHEN the user reaches the end of a page, THE system SHALL display a \"[Load more]\" button that, when activated, retrieves and appends the next 20 posts in the sorted sequence.\n\nTHE system SHALL not display a \"Load more\" button if fewer than 20 posts remain in the sorted list.\n\n## Right Sidebar - Global Latest Posts\n\nTHE system SHALL display a fixed right sidebar on the Home page labeled \"Global Latest\".\n\nWHEN the Home page loads, THE system SHALL display exactly 10 of the most recently created posts across ALL communities, regardless of user subscription status.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT provide a \"Load more\" option for the Global Latest sidebar - it SHALL display exactly 10 items at all times.\n\nWHEN a new post is created in any community, THE system SHALL ensure it becomes eligible for inclusion in the Global Latest listing within 2 seconds of server persistence.\n\nWHERE a post is deleted, THE system SHALL immediately remove it from the Global Latest listing.\n\nWHEN the Global Latest sidebar is displayed, THE system SHALL present each item with the following visual elements:\n\n- Community name (formatted as /c/[community-name])\n- Single-line truncated post title (ellipsized if longer than 100 characters)\n- Relative timestamp (e.g., \"5 minutes ago\", \"1 hour ago\") displayed in the user’s local timezone (Asia/Seoul)\n\n## Community Management Requirements\n\nTHE system SHALL allow members to create public sub-communities with unique alphanumeric names that MAY include hyphens (-) and underscores (_).\n\nWHEN a member attempts to create a community with a name already in use, THE system SHALL reject the request and display \"This name is already in use.\"\n\nWHEN a member attempts to create a community with a name containing invalid characters (e.g., spaces, periods, symbols beyond hyphen/underscore), THE system SHALL reject the request and display \"This name isn't available. Please choose something simpler.\"\n\nTHE system SHALL enforce a minimum name length of 1 character and a maximum length of 50 characters.\n\nTHE community name SHALL be immutable after creation.\n\nTHE system SHALL associate each community with an optional category from the following predefined list: [Tech & Programming] [Science] [Movies & TV] [Games] [Sports] [Lifestyle &

than 20 rules, THE system SHALL accept the input but only persist and display the first 20.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow community owners to edit their community's description, logo, banner, and rules — but SHALL NOT permit renaming of the community.\n\nWHEN a user who is not the original creator attempts to edit a community, THE system SHALL deny the request and display \"You can only edit communities you created.\"\n\nWHEN a community is deleted, THE system SHALL immediately cascade-delete ALL associated posts and comments.\n\nWHEN a community is deleted, THE system SHALL remove it from all user \"Recent Communities\" lists.\n\nTHE system SHALL update the member count of a community in real-time based on successful join/leave actions.\n\nTHE system SHALL display the member count

label from \"Join\" to \"Joined\"\n\nWHEN a user clicks the \"Joined\" button on a community page, THE system SHALL immediately update their membership status to \"Not joined\".\n\nTHE system SHALL then:\n\n- Remove the community from the user’s joined communities list\n- Update the \"Recent Communities\" list in the left sidebar if the community was present\n- Change the button label from \"Joined\" to \"Join\"\n\nWHERE a community is removed from the \"Recent Communities\" list because another community has more recent activity, THE system SHALL preserve the maximum limit of 5 communities.\n\nTHE system SHALL update the \"Recent Communities\" list based on activity recency, where activity is defined as:\n- First post creation\n- First comment on a post\n- First vote on a post or comment\n- First join/leave action\n\nTHE system SHALL order the Recent Communities list by the timestamp of the user's most recent activity within that community, descending.\n\n## Post

Unlike centralized social media platforms, this service emphasizes organic community formation, user-driven content discovery, and decentralized moderation through collective upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. The platform's core innovation lies in its ability to surface quality content through peer validation rather than algorithmic amplification, creating a more authentic and sustainable discussion environment.\n\n## Business Model\n\n### Why This Service Exists\n\nThe modern digital information landscape is characterized by content saturation, algorithmic bias, and declining trust in centralized platforms. Users increasingly crave spaces where they can engage with niche topics without interference from profit-driven feeds or echo chambers. This service fills a critical market gap by providing a Reddit-like experience optimized for clarity, user autonomy, and community self-governance. Unlike competing platforms that prioritize engagement metrics over content quality or impose monetization structures that compromise user experience, this platform places control firmly in the hands of its users.\n\nThe primary market opportunity exists among knowledge workers, lifelong learners, hobbyists, and creative professionals who seek authentic peer-to-peer knowledge sharing without corporate surveillance or manipulative UI patterns. Competitors such as Reddit, Discord, and niche forums provide partial solutions but suffer from inconsistent user experiences, poor discovery mechanisms, or overly complex moderation tools. This platform differentiates itself by offering a cohesive, intuitive, and highly performant interface with built-in community-building tools that require no technical expertise to use.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n\nThe service operates as a freemium model with zero advertising. Revenue is generated through voluntary micro-donations and optional premium membership features:\n\n- **Micro-donations**: Users can send small monetary contributions to community curators, exceptional content creators, or entire communities they value. Donations are processed through secure third-party payment providers with 100% of proceeds flowing to recipients.\n- **Premium Membership (optional)**: A subscription tier provides enhanced discovery tools, advanced community analytics, early access to new features, and the ability to customize community appearance with proprietary themes and layout options. Premium features are entirely optional and do not affect content visibility or algorithmic sorting.\n\nThe platform is structured to require no advertising, affiliate marketing, or data monetization to remain financially sustainable. This reinforces the core value proposition of user privacy and autonomy.\n\n### Growth Plan\n\nUser acquisition will be driven through five primary channels:\n\n1. **Community Seed Networks**: Early adopters in key interest areas (Tech, Science, Art) will be invited to establish foundational communities that serve as anchors in the network.\n2. **Referral Incentives**: Users who invite others who then join and engage with communities will receive enhanced community visibility badges.\n3. **Content Cross-Promotion**: The globally visible \"Latest Posts\" sidebar creates organic traffic between communities, encouraging cross-pollination of audiences.\n4. **Search Engine Optimization**: Content within communities is designed to be naturally indexable, making expert discussions discoverable via search engines.\n5. **Integration with Knowledge Platforms**: Partnerships with academic institutions, open-source projects, and educational resources to embed community links in content repositories.\n\nUser retention will be driven by habit formation through the \"Recent Communities\" sidebar, daily personalized content discovery, and the psychological reward of meaningful community interaction.\n\n### Success Metrics\n\nThe following key performance indicators will be tracked to measure success:\n\n- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Target 50,000 within 12 months\n- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Target 250,000 within 18 months\n- **Average Sessions per User**: Average of 4.5 sessions per day (reinforcing habit formation)\n- **Community Creation Rate**: 500+ new communities created per week\n- **Content Engagement Rate**: Average of 8.3 comments per top post\n- **Donation Conversion Rate**: 8% of registered users make at least one micro-donation annually\n- **Retention Rate (30-day)**: 45% of new users return after 30 days\n- **Community Longevity**: 70% of created communities remain active after 90 days\n\n## Key Features Summary\n\nThe Community Platform delivers the following core functionalities:\n\n- **Topic-Based Sub-Communities**: Users can create and join communities centered on niche topics, with unique names formed from alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.\n- **Open Reading, Controlled Participation**: All content is accessible to everyone; posting, commenting, voting, community creation, and membership require user authentication.\n- **Personalized Main Feed**: The homepage prioritizes content from communities a user has joined, sorted by \"Newest\" or \"Top\" using community-driven scoring mechanisms.\n- **Global Latest Sidebar**: A consistent right sidebar displays the 10 most recent posts across the entire platform, promoting serendipitous discovery.\n- **Persistent Navigation**: Every page features a fixed left sidebar with navigation to Home, Explore, and Create, plus a dynamic Recently Visited Communities list.\n- **User-Driven Voting System**: A one-tap upvote/downvote system where users can toggle between \"None,\" \"Upvote,\" and \"Downvote,\" with scores calculated as upvotes minus downvotes.\n- **Comment Threads**: Nested comment threads support conversational depth without fragmentation.\n- **Community Ownership**: Only the original creator can edit community metadata (description, rules, logo); community name is immutable.\n- **Account-Based Content Ownership**: Users may only edit or delete content they authored.\n- **Session Resumption**: Expired sessions prompt seamless re-authentication without losing context.\n- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Interface updates apply immediately (e.g., vote state, join status) with backend syncing occurring asynchronously.\n- **Flexible Search**: Comprehensive search across posts, communities, and comments with per-category sorting options.\n- **Friendly Relative Time Display**: All timestamps are rendered in the user’s local timezone (Asia/Seoul) using natural language (e.g., \"5 minutes ago\").\n\n## User Roles Introduction\n\nThe platform implements three distinct user roles with clearly defined permissions:\n\n- **Guest**: An unauthenticated user with read-only access to all public content. Guests can browse posts, view communities, and read comments but cannot post, comment, vote, join communities, or create anything.\n- **Member**: An authenticated user who can create and manage their own posts and comments, upvote/downvote content, join or leave communities, and create new sub-communities under predefined naming rules. Members own their content and may edit or delete it only.\n- **Admin**: A system-appointed role with elevated privileges including the ability to delete communities, intervene in abusive behavior, enforce community rules, manage flagged content, and override content ownership when necessary to protect platform integrity. Admins have full Member privileges.\n\nEach role's permissions are enforced at the business logic layer, ensuring that no technical vulnerability can grant unauthorized access.\n\n## Document Navigation Guide\n\nThis document serves as the foundational overview for the entire project. The following documents provide increasingly specific technical and operational details:\n\n- **[User Roles and Permissions](./01-user-roles.md)**: A comprehensive breakdown of permissions for each user role, including authentication workflow and token structure.\n- **[Functional Requirements](./02-functional-requirements.md)**: Detailed prescriptions of every required user-facing action, written in EARS format for unambiguous implementation.\n- **[Business Rules](./03-business-rules.md)**: All input validation, display formatting, session handling, and operational constraints governing system behavior.\n- **[User Journey: Home Feed](./04-user-journey-home.md)**: Step-by-step walkthrough of how users experience the homepage under different conditions.\n- **[User Journey: Explore Communities](./05-user-journey-explore.md)**: Full user journey for discovering and joining new communities.\n- **[User Journey: Create Community](./06-user-journey-create-community.md)**: Process from initiation to completion and aftermath of creating a new community.\n- **[User Journey: Create Post](./07-user-journey-create-post.md)**: End-to-end flow for composing and submitting posts.\n- **[User Journey: Comments](./08-user-journey-comments.md)**: Design of the nested commenting system, including UI and backend state transitions.\n- **[User Journey: Voting](./09-user-journey-voting.md)**: Complete behavioral specification of the upvote/downvote system, including edge cases.\n- **[User Journey: Search](./10-user-journey-search.md)**: Behavior of the search function across all result types with sorting and pagination rules.\n\nAll documents are structured to be read in sequence, with each building upon the previous for maximum clarity and completeness.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

They are curious about community content, may be exploring similar platforms, and are not yet committed to joining. They have no preferences or history on the system.\n\n**Returning Member (Authenticated)**\nAn existing user who has previously joined one or more sub-communities. They return regularly to engage with content from their selected communities, track discussions, and maintain active participation. They expect personalized, timely updates and smooth interaction flows.\n\n### Goal Statement\n\nProvide a seamless, personalized, and intuitive home feed experience that:\n- Displays the most relevant content based on user membership status\n- Enables effortless navigation between sorting modes\n- Reinforces community discovery through the right sidebar\n- Maintains continuous interaction state during login or session expiry\n- Delivers immediate visual feedback on user actions\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n- The user has navigated to `/` (Home page)\n- The system has loaded the global layout (left sidebar, top navbar)\n- The user’s authentication state is known (guest or member)\n- The server has returned the initial set of posts for the UI (20 items)\n- The right sidebar has loaded the latest 10 posts across all communities\n- The sort control is initialized to \"Newest\"\n\n### Main Success Scenario (Authenticated Member)\n\n1. **Home Feed Initialization**\n   - THE system SHALL display a list of 20 post cards from sub-communities the user has joined.\n   - WHERE the user has joined at least one community, THE system SHALL exclude posts from communities they have not joined.\n   \n2. **Sorting Behavior**\n   - WHEN the user selects \"Newest\" from the sort dropdown, THE system SHALL order posts by creation time descending (most recent first).\n   - WHEN two or more posts have identical creation times, THE system SHALL prioritize the post with the higher numeric identifier (later-generated post).\n   - WHEN the user selects \"Top\" from the sort dropdown, THE system SHALL order posts by score (upvotes minus downvotes) descending.\n   - WHEN two or more posts have identical scores, THE system SHALL prioritize the post with the more recent creation time.\n   - WHEN two or more posts have identical scores and identical creation times, THE system SHALL prioritize the post with the higher numeric identifier.\n\n3. **Content Display**\n   - THE system SHALL render each post card with:\n     - Community name (e.g., \"/c/ai\") as a clickable link\n     - Post title (truncated if exceeding display width)\n     - Author display name (if set, otherwise \"Anonymous\")\n     - Relative time stamp (e.g., \"2 minutes ago\", formatted to Seoul timezone)\n     - Comment count (numeric value)\n     - Score (calculated as upvotes minus downvotes, displayed as a number)\n     - Upvote and downvote buttons (with current vote state indicated)\n\n4. **Load More Interaction**\n   - WHEN the user clicks \"Load more\", THE system SHALL fetch the next 20 posts matching the current sort order and membership filters.\n   - THEN THE system SHALL append the new 20 posts to the bottom of the existing list without scrolling or reloading the page.\n\n5. **Join/Leave Actions**\n   - WHEN the user joins a new community from the \"Explore\" page or community header, THE system SHALL immediately add the latest posts from that community to the home feed.\n   - WHEN the user leaves a community, THE system SHALL immediately remove all posts from that community from the home feed.\n   - THEN THE system SHALL update the \"Recent Communities\" list in the left sidebar to include the newly joined (or removed) community, keeping the list to a maximum of 5 entries ordered by most recent interaction.\n\n6. **Optimistic Updates**\n   - WHEN the user upvotes or downvotes a post, THE system SHALL immediately update the vote button state and score in the UI.\n   - THEN THE system SHALL send the vote to the server in the background.\n   - IF the server response fails, THE system SHALL revert the UI state to its previous condition and display: \"A temporary error occurred. Please try again in a moment.\"\n\n7. **Session Expiry Handling**\n   - IF the user’s session expires while interacting with the home feed, THE system SHALL show a non-intrusive banner: \"Your session has expired. Please sign in to continue.\"\n   - THEN THE system SHALL preserve the current sort, scroll position, and all pending actions (e.g., pending vote, comment draft).\n   - WHEN the user completes re-login via modal, THE system SHALL automatically resume the previous state and execute any pending actions.\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\n#### Scenario 1: Guest User (Unauthenticated)\n\n- WHEN a guest navigates to `/`, THE system SHALL display 20 of the most recent or highest-scoring posts from ALL communities (not filtered by membership).\n- THEN THE system SHALL display a banner above the feed: \"Welcome! Join communities to personalize your feed. Explore popular topics below.\"\n- WHEN a guest attempts to upvote, downvote, comment, or post, THE system SHALL show a login prompt modal with message: \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n- WHEN the guest successfully logs in, THE system SHALL switch to the authenticated home feed experience, applying the appropriate membership filters.\n\n#### Scenario 2: No Joined Communities\n\n- WHEN a member has joined zero communities, THE system SHALL behave identically to the guest experience, showing global content.\n- THEN THE system SHALL display a guidance message below the sort control: \"You haven’t joined any communities yet. Visit Explore to find topics you love.\"\n- WHEN the user joins their first community, THE system SHALL immediately filter the feed to include only posts from that community.\n\n#### Scenario 3: Invalid Sort Selection\n\n- IF the sort dropdown is programmatically set to an unrecognized value (e.g., due to a URL manipulation or bug), THE system SHALL default to \"Newest\".\n- THEN THE system SHALL update the UI to reflect the default sort and log a warning to developer tools.\n\n#### Scenario 4: Empty Feed\n\n- WHEN a member has joined communities, but no posts exist in those communities, THE system SHALL display: \"No posts yet in your communities. Be the first to share something!\"\n- THEN THE system SHALL display a \"Create Post\" button directly in the feed area.\n\n#### Scenario 5: Right Sidebar Updates\n\n- WHEN a new post is created in any community, THE system SHALL immediately append it to the top of the right sidebar’s \"Global Latest\" list (if not already present).\n- WHEN the \"Global Latest\" list exceeds 10 items, THE system SHALL remove the oldest item to maintain the limit of 10.\n- THE system SHALL never remove a post from the right sidebar if it is currently displayed in the main feed (even if older), to avoid inconsistency between views.\n\n#### Scenario 6: Concurrent Feed Updates\n\n- WHILE the user scrolls through the feed, THE system SHALL allow background polling or WebSocket updates to detect new posts in joined communities.\n- IF a new post arrives that matches the current sort criteria, THE system SHALL insert it into the correct position in the feed.\n- THEN THE system SHALL animate a subtle highlight on the newly added post card for 3 seconds to guide attention.\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\n- **For Authenticated Members**:\n  - The home feed becomes a personalized, dynamically updated hub of community content.\n  - User’s engagement (joining, voting, commenting) immediately influences their content exposure.\n  - The right sidebar maintains awareness of platform-wide activity, encouraging community exploration.\n  - The Recent Communities list grows organically as a reflection of active user interest.\n\n- **For Guests**:\n  - The feed serves as a public showcase of platform content, lowering the barrier to entry.\n  - The guidance messaging and visibility of the Explore button support user conversion to members.\n  - All interactive elements are gated with clear, non-disruptive login prompts.\n\n- **For the System**:\n  - The home feed abstraction handles both authenticated and guest states with a single rendering pipeline.\n  - Sorting and pagination logic is consistent across all contexts (Home, Search, Explore).\n  - The optimistic UI updates and session recovery pattern ensure high user retention and perceived reliability.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

They are interested in discovering and participating in topic-based sub-communities. This user may be:\n- A guest (unauthenticated) browsing content to evaluate the platform\n- A member who has joined a few communities but is seeking new ones\n- An infrequent user returning after inactivity and looking to re-engage\n\nThis user is motivated by curiosity, shared interests, and desire to participate in relevant discussions. They do not know which communities exist or which are active; they rely on the platform to surface relevant communities effectively.\n\n### Goal Statement\n\nThe user wants to discover new sub-communities based on their interests, explore community content and rules, and join one or more communities to customize their home feed and participate in discussions.\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n- The user has navigated to the /c route (Explore sub-communities page)\n- The user's session state is either authenticated (member) or unauthenticated (guest)\n- The system has loaded the full list of available sub-communities, categorized by the predefined list: [Tech & Programming] [Science] [Movies & TV] [Games] [Sports] [Lifestyle & Wellness] [Study & Education] [Art & Design] [Business & Finance] [News & Current Affairs]\n- The left sidebar displays the fixed navigation: Home / Explore / Create buttons and up to 5 Recent Communities entries\n- The right sidebar is not used on this page\n- The global navbar shows the logo, search input, Create (post) button, and Profile dropdown\n\n### Main Success Scenario (Authenticated User)\n\nWHEN a member user navigates to the Explore page (/c), THE system SHALL display:\n\n1. A horizontal row of category chips, exactly in this order: [Tech & Programming] [Science] [Movies & TV] [Games] [Sports] [Lifestyle & Wellness] [Study & Education] [Art & Design] [Business & Finance] [News & Current Affairs]\n2. A grid of 20 community cards, sorted alphabetically by community name, showing only communities that have been created\n3. Each community card shall display:\n   - Top: Community logo (if available; otherwise a default icon)\n   - Community name (as registered)\n   - Member count (rounded and abbreviated: 1,000 → 1k, 10,000 → 12k, 1,000,000 → 1.2m)\n   - A join button with default text \"Join\"\n4. The member count appears directly below the community name\n5. The \"Join\" button is a primary actionable element in the bottom-right corner of the card\n6. Each category chip is clickable and has no initial selection state\n\nWHEN the user clicks a category chip, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Immediately hide all community cards that do not belong to the selected category\n2. Immediately show only community cards belonging to the selected category\n3. Apply visual highlight (e.g., filled background) to the clicked category chip\n4. Preserve existing scroll position within the grid\n\nWHEN the user clicks the \"Join\" button on a community card, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Immediately change button text from \"Join\" to \"Joined\"\n2. Immediately update the Recent Communities list in the left sidebar:\n   a. If the community is not already in the list, add it as the first item\n   b. If the community is already in the list, move it to the first position\n   c. If the list already contains 5 communities and a new one is added, remove the last (oldest) entry\n3. Immediately add posts from this newly joined community to the user’s home feed (next time they navigate to /)\n4. Do not remove the community from the Explore grid - it remains visible but with \"Joined\" state\n\nWHILE the user is viewing the Explore page, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Allow infinite scrolling with \"[Load more]\" button at bottom\n2. Load additional 20 community cards when \"[Load more]\" is clicked\n3. Preserve category filter during new loads\n4. Maintain joined state visibility (\"Joined\" button) in newly loaded cards\n\nWHEN the user clicks \"[Load more]\" in an active category filter, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Fetch the next 20 communities belonging to the selected category\n2. Append them to the bottom of the existing grid\n3. Maintain the \"Joined\" state for any community the user has already joined\n\nWHEN a user clicks on a community name in a card, THE system SHALL navigate to the community’s home page at /c/[name].\n\nWHEN the user clicks the \"Joined\" button on a community card, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Immediately change button text from \"Joined\" to \"Join\"\n2. Immediately remove this community from the Recent Communities list if it was present\n3. Immediately exclude all posts from this community from the user’s Home feed\n\nWHILE a user has active category filtering, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Retain the applied category filter state during any navigation away and back\n2. Preserve \"Joined\" button states for all communities that have been joined\n3. Update pagination counter if user changes filters (e.g., \"Showing 8 of 120 communities\")\n\nWHERE a community has no description, THE system SHALL display an empty description field in the community card.\n\nWHERE a community has no logo, THE system SHALL display a default placeholder icon in the card.\n\n### Main Success Scenario (Guest User)\n\nWHEN a guest user navigates to the Explore page (/c), THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Display all category chips in the fixed alphabetical order\n2. Display 20 community cards exactly as described in the authenticated user scenario\n3. Display button text as \"Join\" for all communities\n4. Disable all interactive behaviors of the \"Join\" button (no mouse hover effect, no click response)\n5. Show a prominent overlay or banner above the community grid with message: \"Please sign in to continue. Join communities to customize your feed.\"\n6. Display an outline (non-filled) \"Join\" button with cursor set to \"not-allowed\"\n\nWHEN a guest user clicks the \"Join\" button on any community, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Prevent any UI state change on the Explore page\n2. Immediately display a login modal overlay (without navigation or URL change)\n3. Preserve the scroll position and category filter state\n4. After successful login, automatically return to the Explore page at the same scroll position and category filter\n5. Immediately update the clicked button from \"Join\" to \"Joined\" in the UI\n6. Immediately add the community to the Recent Communities list in the left sidebar\n\nWHEN the user attempts to click a community name while logged out, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Navigate to the community page (/c/[name]) as if clicked\n2. Immediately interrupt with login modal overlay\n3. After successful login, redirect to the exact community page (/c/[name])\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\nIF a user has joined more than 100 communities, THEN THE system SHALL still show all filtered communities in the Explore grid with correct \"Joined\" state.\n\nIF a community has been deleted by an admin, THEN THE system SHALL: \n\n1. Never display the deleted community in any Explore grid\n2. If the user has previously joined it, remove it silently from Recent Communities list and from their Home feed\n3. Do not show any error message or broken link\n\nIF there are no communities in a selected category, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Display a single card in the grid with message: \"No communities found in this category.\"\n2. Keep the category chip highlighted\n3. Disable \"[Load more]\" button\n\nIF the user has joined 5 or more communities, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Maintain only the 5 most recently joined communities in the Recent Communities list\n2. Order by most recent activity (join date/time), descending\n3. If two communities were joined at the same time, prioritize by community creation date (older first)\n\nIF a community name changes due to system administrative action, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Ensure the Explore page reflects the new community name\n2. Update any links from Recent Communities list to point to the new name\n3. Do not break joined state; membership remains active\n\nIF the user logs out while on the Explore page, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Clear the Recent Communities list\n2. Keep category filter setting for future login sessions\n3. Reset all \"Joined\" buttons to \"Join\" state\n\nIF the user performs multiple rapid clicks on the \"Join\" button before response, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Disable the button temporarily after first click\n2. Re-enable after server response or 2 seconds\n3. Guarantee that the final state matches server state (idempotent behavior)\n\nIF the server returns error while updating join state, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Restore the button to its previous state (Join ↔ Joined)\n2. Do not remove the community from Recent Communities list\n3. Show a transient (auto-hiding) banner: \"A temporary error occurred. Please try again in a moment.\"\n\nIF the user searches for communities via global search bar while on /c, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Redirect to /s with pre-filled category selection filter\n2. Auto-switch to the Sub-Communities tab in search results\n3. Apply the same term and preserve context\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\nAfter successfully joining a community:\n\n- The community appears in the Recent Communities list (up to 5)\n- The \"Join\" button on the Explore page changes to \"Joined\"\n- The user's Home feed will now include this community's posts when sorted\n- In future sessions, the community remains in Recent Communities list until replaced by more recent activity\n- If the user joins a community, then leaves it, then rejoins, it resets to top of Recent Communities list\n\nAfter clicking a community name in Explore:\n\n- The user is taken to /c/[name]\n- The left sidebar maintains the same Recent Communities list\n- The right sidebar now shows: Community Info + Rules (as specified in the requirements)\n- The \"Join\" button in the community header reflects joined status\n\nAfter leaving a community:\n\n- The community disappears from Recent Communities list\n- Posts from this community are excluded from the user's Home feed\n- The Explore page updates the button to \"Join\" immediately\n\n## Diagram: Community Explore and Join Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Start: User on /c] --> B[Display 10 Category Chips]\n    B --> C[Display 20 Community Cards: Logo, Name, Member Count, Join Button]\n    C --> D{User clicks Category Chip?}\n    D -->|Yes| E[Filter Grid by Category]\n    E --> F[Show only communities in category]\n    F --> C\n    D -->|No| G{User clicks \"Join\" button?}\n    G -->|Yes| H[Check Auth State]\n    H -->|Guest| I[Show Login Modal Overlay]\n    I --> J{Login Successful?}\n    J -->|Yes| K[Update Button: \"Join\" → \"Joined\"]\n    J -->|No| I\n    H -->|Member| K\n    K --> L[Update Recent Communities List: Add Community First]\n    L --> M[Add Community to User's Home Feed (next visit)]\n    G -->|No| N{User clicks Community Name?}\n    N -->|Yes| O[Redirect to /c/[name]]\n    N -->|No| P{User clicks \"[Load more]\"?}\n    P -->|Yes| Q[Fetch Next 20 Communities]\n    Q --> R[Append to Grid, preserve filter and Join state]\n    R --> C\n    P -->|No| S[Idle: Wait for interaction]\n    S --> A\n```\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

This user is typically passionate about a specific subject, has identified a gap in existing communities, and desires a dedicated space for like-minded individuals to share and discuss. They are not necessarily an administrator or moderator, but they act as the initial steward of this new community. They act on a desire for cultural contribution, not technical control — they expect the platform to guide them through setup intuitively.\n\n### Goal Statement\n\nThe user aims to create a new sub-community with a unique name, background description, optional rules, and a representative visual identity (logo or banner). They want to complete this process in a frictionless, single-session flow, with instant feedback on failures (e.g., duplicate names) and immediate navigation to the newly created community home page. Their deeper goal is to establish a meaningful space where others can join, post, and engage — transforming from a passive observer into an active community builder.\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\nWHEN a user intends to create a community, THE system SHALL ensure the following pre-conditions are met:\n\n- THE user SHALL be logged in as a **member** (not authenticated as guest or admin-only)\n- THE user SHALL have no previously created community with the exact same name (even if deleted)\n- THE user SHALL be on a page where the \"Create\" button is available — typically on Home or Explore\n- THE user SHALL have a valid, active session (not expired)\n- THE system SHALL be running the current software version\n- WHEN the user has been identified as a member, THE system SHALL enable the Create Community button\n\n### Main Success Scenario\n\nWHEN a member user initiates community creation, THE system SHALL execute the following process:\n\n1. THE user SHALL click the \"Create\" button in the left sidebar or top navbar\n2. THE system SHALL navigate the user to \"/c/create\" page\n3. THE system SHALL render a form with the following fields in order:\n   - [Name]: Text input, mandatory\n   - [Description]: Text area, optional\n   - [Logo]: File upload input, optional\n   - [Banner]: File upload input, optional\n   - [Rules]: Text area (up to 5 rules), optional\n   - [Category]: Single-select dropdown, mandatory — options are: [\"Tech & Programming\", \"Science\", \"Movies & TV\", \"Games\", \"Sports\", \"Lifestyle & Wellness\", \"Study & Education\", \"Art & Design\", \"Business & Finance\", \"News & Current Affairs\"]\n   - [Create Community]: Submit button\n4. THE user SHALL type or paste the desired community name\n5. THE system SHALL dynamically validate the community name in real time as the user types\n   - WHEN the name is empty, THE system SHALL show placeholder text: \"A short, readable name for your community\"\n   - WHEN the name contains characters other than alphanumeric, hyphen (-), or underscore (_), THE system SHALL immediately display: \"This name isn’t available. Please choose something simpler.\"\n   - WHEN the name is 1–4 characters long, THE system SHALL show: \"This name isn’t available. Please choose something simpler.\"\n   - WHEN the name is 5+ characters and contains only allowed characters, THE system SHALL show: \"Name is available\"\n   - WHEN the name is already taken by an existing community, THE system SHALL show: \"This name is already in use.\"\n6. THE user SHALL optionally upload a logo image (supports PNG, JPG, SVG; size limit: 2MB)\n7. THE user SHALL optionally upload a banner image (supports PNG, JPG; size limit: 5MB)\n8. THE user SHALL optionally enter community rules, each rule as a separate line:\n   - THE system SHALL allow up to 10 lines (rules)\n   - EACH rule SHALL be at most 120 characters\n   - THE system SHALL NOT enforce numbering — the display will auto-number top 5 on community home\n9. THE user SHALL select ONE category from the predefined dropdown list\n10. THE user SHALL click \"Create Community\" button\n11. THE system SHALL:\n    - Accept the request and initiate background creation\n    - Verify all required fields are populated (name and category)\n    - Verify name is unique and valid\n    - Validate file types and sizes\n    - Store metadata in persistent storage (community name, description, creator ID, category, creation timestamp)\n    - Store uploaded files (if any) with UUID-based identifiers and permanent URLs\n    - Assign default placeholder logo or banner if upload was skipped\n12. THE system SHALL immediately redirect the user to the newly created community’s home page at \"/c/[name]\"\n13. THE system SHALL trigger the following observable updates\n    - The user’s \"Recent Communities\" list in the left sidebar SHALL be updated to include the new community (as first item), trimmed to maximum 5 entries by recency\n    - THE user SHALL automatically be marked as \"Joined\" the new community\n    - THE user SHALL see their own posts appear in the main feed of the community page\n14. THE system SHALL display the community home page with:\n    - Logo and banner (if uploaded) or default images\n    - \"Joined\" button styled as active\n    - Community description\n    - Community name in header\n    - Category tag below name\n    - Up to 20 latest posts (if any)\n    - Sort toggle: [Newest] | [Top]\n    - Post composer section visible\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\n#### A. Community Name Already Taken\n\nWHEN a user inputs a community name that already exists in the system, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Immediately update the name field visual state to indicate error\n2. Display the static message: \"This name is already in use.\"\n3. Keep the \"Create Community\" button disabled\n4. Prevent the user from proceeding\n5. When the user updates the name to something unique (valid format)\n6. Hide the error message\n7. Enable the \"Create Community\" button\n\n#### B. User Submits with Missing Required Fields\n\nWHEN a user clicks \"Create Community\" with:\n\n- Empty community name, OR\n- No category selected\n\nTHE system SHALL:\n\n1. Not send the request to the backend\n2. Display an inline alert: \"Please enter a valid community name and select a category.\"\n3. Visually highlight the focused field (e.g., red border)\n4. Remain on the form for correction\n5. Not navigate away from the page\n\n#### C. Invalid Name Format\n\nWHEN a user inputs a community name containing any of the following:\n\n- Spaces\n- Symbols: @, #, $, %, &, *, ?, <, >, |, \\, /, \", ', ` \n- Unicode characters outside alphanumeric range\n- Leading or trailing hyphens or underscores\n\nTHE system SHALL:\n\n1. Display: \"This name isn’t available. Please choose something simpler.\"\n2. Keep the \"Create Community\" button disabled\n3. Mark the field with visual error indicators\n4. Prevent submission\n\n#### D. Network Failure During Creation\n\nWHILE a user clicks \"Create Community\" and the HTTP request fails, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Show: \"A temporary error occurred. Please try again in a moment.\"\n2. Keep the form visible with all entered data preserved\n3. Allow the user to click \"Create Community\" again\n4. Not redirect the user\n5. Log the failure for debugging\n\n#### E. Time-out / Session Expired During Creation\n\nWHEN the user begins creation and the authentication token expires before submission, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Interrupt the operation\n2. Display a modal login prompt\n3. Return the user to the \"/c/create\" page with form data intact (name, description, rules)\n4. Re-reference uploaded files from local storage if supported\n5. Allow user to retry creation without re-entering\n\n#### F. Uploading Large or Invalid Files\n\nWHEN a user attempts to upload a logo file larger than 2MB or a banner larger than 5MB, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Immediately interrupt the file selection\n2. Show: \"File too large. Logo must be under 2MB. Banner must be under 5MB.\"\n\nWHEN a user uploads a non-image file (e.g., PDF, ZIP) as logo/banner, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Show: \"Invalid file type. Only images (JPG, PNG, SVG) are allowed.\"\n2. Reset the file input\n3. Allow the user to try again\n\n#### G. User Leaves Page Before Creation\n\nWHEN the user navigates away from \"/c/create\" before submitting (e.g., clicks browser back button), THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Discard all form state\n2. Not save any incomplete community draft\n3. Not create a \"pending\" community\n4. Not retain any trace of the uncompleted attempt in the database\n5. Return the user to the previous page in the navigation history\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\nWHEN a community is created successfully, THE system SHALL guarantee the following outcomes:\n\n- THE user SHALL be redirected to \"/c/[name]\" — the community’s home page\n- THE user SHALL appear in the \"Joined\" state on the community page\n- THE user SHALL be granted the ability to edit metadata (description, logo, banner, rules) — name remains immutable\n- THE system SHALL register the user as the original creator (owner) of the community\n- THE user’s \"Recent Communities\" list SHALL be updated with the new community added at the top\n- THE new community SHALL appear in search results for its name\n- THE community SHALL be visible in the Explore page under its selected category\n- THE user SHALL be able to submit their first post immediately on the community page\n- THE community SHALL inherit default permissions: no moderation, open posting, and membership-based feed inclusion\n- THE system SHALL generate a community ID and assign it internally (unexposed to user)\n- THE system SHALL create an audit entry: \"Community [name] created by user [ID]\"\n\n### Associated Business Rules (Cross-Referenced)\n\n- /* AUTO-REF 03-business-rules.md */ Community name SHALL be alphanumeric with hyphen (-) and underscore (_) only\n- /* AUTO-REF 03-business-rules.md */ Community name SHALL be 5–64 characters long\n- /* AUTO-REF 03-business-rules.md */ If logo or banner is missing, THE system SHALL use a default placeholder image\n- /* AUTO-REF 03-business-rules.md */ Rules shall be stored internally as string array; only top 5 are shown on UI\n- /* AUTO-REF 03-business-rules.md */ Category selection SHALL be enforced as one from the exact list provided\n- /* AUTO-REF 01-user-roles.md */ Only users with \"member\" role SHALL be allowed to create communities\n- /* AUTO-REF 01-user-roles.md */ Editor privileges for community metadata SHALL be limited to the creator\n- /* AUTO-REF 02-functional-requirements.md */ Community name SHALL be unique — duplicates SHALL be rejected at the point of entry\n- /* AUTO-REF 02-functional-requirements.md */ Community creation SHALL not require membership — it creates the community first\n\n### System Behavior Summary\n\n- The entire flow is designed to be **single-step, high-response, and immediately rewarding**\n- The community is **created immediately** upon successful submission — no approval workflows\n- The user’s transition from \"creator\" to \"member\" is **automatic and seamless**\n- Validation is **front-end heavy** for UX, but **back-end enforced** for integrity\n- Error recovery is **user-friendly** — form state is retained on input validation failures\n- Session handling ensures **flow continuity even after re-login**\n- No community data is stored persistently until the \"Create\" button is successfully clicked\n\n\n\n## Diagram: Community Creation Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Start: User on \"Create\" page] --> B[Display Form]\n    B --> C[User Types Community Name]\n    C --> D{Valid Name?}\n    D -->|No| E[Show Error: \"This name isn't available\" or \"This name is already in use\"]\n    E --> C\n    D -->|Yes| F[User Enters Description]\n    F --> G[User Uploads Logo (Optional)]\n    G --> H[User Uploads Banner (Optional)]\n    H --> I[User Enters Rules (Optional)]\n    I --> J[User Selects Category]\n    J --> K[User Clicks \"Create Community\"]\n    K --> L{All Required Fields?}\n    L -->|No| M[Show Alert: \"Please enter a valid community name and select a category\"]\n    M --> J\n    L -->|Yes| N[Send Create Request to Backend]\n    N --> O{Request Succeeds?}\n    O -->|Yes| P[Redirect to /c/[name] instantly]\n    O -->|No| Q[Show Error: \"A temporary error occurred.

The user may be new to the platform or returning after an absence. They seek to contribute meaningfully to a sub-community by sharing ideas, asking questions, or sparking discussion. They are not concerned with technical implementation but expect intuitive, reliable behavior that respects their ownership of content.\n\n### Goal Statement\n\nTo create a new post in a chosen sub-community and have it appear in the feed immediately, with full understanding of visibility rules, author attribution, and editing controls—while being seamlessly guided through authentication if needed.\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n- User is either authenticated as a **Member** or is a **Guest**.\n- User is on any page of the platform: Home, Explore, Community Home, or Search.\n- User has identified a target sub-community for posting (either via navigation or directly from the Create Post button).\n- The system has successfully loaded the user’s session state and community list.\n\n### Main Success Scenario\n\n#### 1. Initiation of Post Creation\n\n- The user clicks the **Create post** button from the global navigation bar (visible on all pages).\n- The system redirects the user to the **/submit** page.\n- If the user is not logged in, the system displays a modal login prompt over the /submit page.\n\n#### 2. Community Selection\n\n- On the /submit page, the user sees a **Community selector** dropdown.\n- The dropdown displays all available sub-communities, grouped by category, sorted by name.\n- The system pre-selects the community the user intended (if navigated from a community page, such as /c/ai) or defaults to the most recently visited community.\n- If the user leaves the dropdown unchanged and attempts submission, the system displays an error: “Please choose a community to post in.”\n\n#### 3. Title and Body Input\n\n- The user enters a **title** between 5 and 120 characters.\n  - If the title is less than 5 characters, the “Submit” button is disabled and a tooltip appears: “Title must be at least 5 characters.”\n  - If the title exceeds 120 characters, the input field shows a character counter in red at 115+ and prevents further input.\n- The user enters a **body** between 10 and 10,000 characters.\n  - Plain text and line breaks are allowed.\n  - No HTML, JavaScript, emoji, or markdown formatting is permitted—these are stripped if pasted.\n  - If the body is fewer than 10 characters, the “Submit” button is disabled and a tooltip appears: “Your post needs more detail. Add at least 10 characters.”\n  - If the body exceeds 10,000 characters, input is capped, and a indicator shows “10,000/10,000” in red.\n- The user optionally enters an **author display name** up to 32 characters.\n  - If left blank, the system assigns the default value: “Anonymous”.\n  - If the entered name contains HTML characters (<, >, &), they are escaped automatically.\n\n#### 4. Submission and Server Processing\n\n- The user clicks **Submit**.\n- The system sends a request to the backend with the following data:\n  - Selected community name\n  - Title and body content\n  - Author display name (or \"Anonymous\" if empty)\n  - Timestamp (client-side, in ISO format)\n  - User ID (from JWT)\n- The backend validates:\n  - User is authenticated.\n  - Community exists.\n  - Title and body meet length constraints.\n  - No disallowed content (scripts, links, markdown) is present.\n- The backend creates a new post record and assigns a unique numeric ID.\n- The backend returns a success response with the new post ID.\n\n#### 5. Success Feedback and Display\n\n- The system immediately (optimistically):\n  - Navigates the user to the **community home page** (e.g., /c/ai).\n  - Displays the newly created post in the feed at the top of the list, with the correct attributes:\n    - Community name (e.g., /c/ai)\n    - Title\n    - Author name (“Anonymous” if not set)\n    - Relative time: “just now”\n    - Comment count: 0\n    - Score: 0\n- The system automatically adds the community to the **Recent Communities** list in the left sidebar, if not already present (up to 5 entries, ordered chronologically by last interaction).\n- If the community was not previously joined, the user does not see the post in their Home feed (since joining is required for Home feed inclusion)—only in the community-specific feed.\n- The system updates the **post count** in the community info card.\n- The backend synchronizes the event to update global feed caches for the **Global Latest** sidebar.\n\n#### 6. Post Editing\n\n- Later, the user returns to the post.\n- The system displays **Edit** and **Delete** buttons only if the current user ID matches the post’s author ID.\n- If the user selects **Edit**:\n  - The system opens the /submit page again with the original values prefilled.\n  - The user makes changes and re-submits.\n  - The system updates the post content and updates the “edited” flag (displayed as “edited 2m ago”) in the UI.\n- If the user selects **Delete**:\n  - The system asks for confirmation: “Delete this post? This cannot be undone.”\n  - Upon confirmation, the post is removed from the feed and posts database.\n  - The system immediately removes the post component from the UI and decrements the comment count and community post total.\n  - A server-side background task schedules low-volume cleanup of orphaned comments, if any.\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\n#### Scenario 1: Guest Attempts to Create a Post\n\n- The user clicks **Create post** from any page.\n- The system immediately opens the login modal with the message: “Please sign in to continue.”\n- The user enters their credentials:\n  - If login fails: the system shows “Login failed. Please try again.” in a non-blocking banner.\n  - If login succeeds: the system URI is reconstructed to return the user to the **/submit** page with original community prefilled.\n- The user completes the post as in the Main Success Scenario.\n- The original action (creating a post) is resumed seamlessly.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Session Expires Mid-Submission\n\n- The user begins drafting a post and walks away for 40 minutes.\n- The JWT access token expires.\n- When the user clicks **Submit**, the API returns HTTP 401.\n- The system:\n  - Shows a subtle banner at the top: “Your session expired. Please log in again to continue.”\n  - Automatically opens the login modal overlay.\n  - After successful login, returns the user to the **/submit** page with all previously entered content still present.\n  - Allows re-submission without loss of work.\n\n#### Scenario 3: Title or Body Has Invalid Characters\n\n- The user pastes a snippet of HTML or JavaScript into the body field.\n- As they type or paste, the system autobinds a sanitization parser.\n- All script tags, style elements, iframe src attributes, and event handlers (onload, onclick) are removed.\n- Remaining content is preserved as plain text.\n- A notification briefly appears: “Text formatting has been removed for safety.”\n- The user is not blocked from submitting; only harmful code is stripped.\n\n#### Scenario 4: Community Name Already Exists\n\n- The user tries to create a new community with a name that already exists.\n- The system returns a response: “This name is already in use.”\n- The input field for community name shows a red border and icon.\n- The user is encouraged to try an alternate name.\n- **No attempt is made to auto-generate a name**—user must choose.\n\n#### Scenario 5: Empty Author Display Name\n\n- The user leaves the author display name field blank.\n- Upon submit, the system automatically replaces the empty value with “Anonymous” before sending to backend.\n- The post appears in all feeds with “Anonymous” as the author.\n- The user sees their own post labeled as “Anonymous” and may later choose to edit it to set a custom display name.\n\n#### Scenario 6: Page Refresh After Submission\n\n- The user submits a post and is redirected to the community home.\n- The user refreshes the page.\n- The system reloads the community feed.\n- The newly created post appears again in position #1 (newest)\n- The system does not re-submit or duplicate the post.\n- The user has no indication that the post was resent; the display is consistent with initial load.\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\nAfter a successful post creation and interaction:\n\n- **Post appears in**:\n  - The selected community’s feed.\n  - The **Global Latest** sidebar (if within 10 most recent posts)\n  - Search results across categories when queried\n- **Post does not appear in**:\n  - The **Home feed** unless the user has also joined the community\n- **Author rights**:\n  - Only the original poster (by UUID) may edit or delete the post.\n  - Admins may delete any post (handled via backend role check).\n- **Engagement**:\n  - Other users may upvote, downvote, or comment on the post.\n  - The post’s score (upvotes - downvotes) updates immediately in the UI.\n  - This update is optimistic (shown before backend sync)—if sync fails, the UI reverts with a “Something went wrong” message.\n- **Visibility**:\n  - The post’s time is displayed in **Asia/Seoul** local timezone using relative format:\n    - “just now” (0–1 min)\n    - “X minutes ago” (1–59 min)\n    - “X hours ago” (1–23 hr)\n    - “X days ago” (1+ days)\n- **Ownership**:\n  - The author retains personal control even if the community is later deleted.\n  - If the community is deleted, the post is removed.\n  - If the author account is deleted, the post becomes “Anonymous” with a placeholder ID.\n\n### Business Requirements (EARS Format)\n\nAll requirements are written in EARS format using English keywords and user locale (en-US) for descriptions.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to create a post without selecting a community, THE system SHALL disable the Submit button and display: “Please choose a community to post in.”\n\nWHEN a user submits a post with a title fewer than 5 characters, THE system SHALL prevent submission and display: “Title must be at least 5 characters.”\n\nWHEN a user submits a post with a body fewer than 10 characters, THE system SHALL prevent submission and display: “Your post needs more detail. Add at least 10 characters.”\n\nWHEN a user submits a post with a title exceeding 120 characters, THE system SHALL cap input and display a red counter at 115+.\n\nWHEN a user submits a post with a body exceeding 10,000 characters, THE system SHALL cap input and display: “10,000/10,000” in red.\n\nWHEN a user leaves the author display name empty, THE system SHALL assign the default value: “Anonymous”.\n\nWHEN a user submits a post with HTML, JavaScript, or script tags, THE system SHALL strip all executable content and preserve only plain text with line breaks.\n\nWHEN a user who is not logged in attempts to create a post, THE system SHALL display a login modal with: “Please sign in to continue.” and retain the form state.\n\nWHEN a user logs in successfully after being prompted, THE system SHALL redirect to the original post creation page (/submit) with all fields preserved.\n\nWHEN a user’s session expires during submission, THE system SHALL show: “Your session expired. Please log in again to continue.” and reopen the login modal.\n\nWHEN a user submits a post successfully, THE system SHALL navigate to the target community’s home and display the new post in position #1.\n\nWHEN a user edits their own post, THE system SHALL allow modification of title and body, preserve the original author and ID, and set an “edited” timestamp.\n\nWHEN a user deletes their own post, THE system SHALL confirm with: “Delete this post? This cannot be undone.” and then remove the post from all displays.\n\nWHEN a user upvotes or downvotes a post, THE system SHALL immediately update the score in the UI and optimize for connectivity.\n\nIF a user attempts to vote on their own post, THEN THE system SHALL disable voting buttons and display: “You can’t vote on your own posts/comments.”\n\nWHILE a post is interacting with the network for sync, THE system SHALL display a subtle animation on the score and comment count fields.\n\nWHERE a post’s community is deleted, THE system SHALL remove the post from all feeds and purge it from storage.\n\nWHERE a user’s account is deleted, THE system SHALL reassign the post’s author to “Anonymous” and preserve all other content.\n\nWHERE a community is joined by the user, THE system SHALL include its posts in the Home feed.\n\nWHERE a community is left by the user, THE system SHALL remove its posts from the Home feed.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Post Creation and Display Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"Start: User on /submit\"] --> B[\"User login?\"]\n    B -->|Guest| C[\"Login modal\"]\n    C --> D[\"User enters info\"]\n    D --> E[\"Valid login?\"]\n    E -->|Yes| F[\"Redirect to /submit\"]\n    E -->|No| C\n    F --> G[\"Select community\"]\n    G --> H[\"Valid community?\"]\n    H -->|No| I[\"Show error: \\\"Please choose a community to post in.\\\"\"]\n    H -->|Yes| J[\"Enter title and body\"]\n    J --> K[\"Valid title and body?\"]\n    K -->|No| L[\"Show length error messages\"]\n    K -->|Yes| M[\"Submit post\"]\n    M --> N[\"Backend validation\"]\n    N --> O[\"Success?\"]\n    O -->|Yes| P[\"Redirect to /c/[name]\"]\n    O -->|No| L\n    P --> Q[\"Display new post in feed\"]\n    Q --> R[\"Update Recent Communities list\"]\n    R --> S[\"Update community post count\"]\n    S --> T[\"Sync Global Latest feed\"]\n    T --> U[\"Post creation complete\"]\n    I --> V[\"Return to /submit\"]\n    L --> V\n```\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

IF the user clicks the \"Reply\" button on an existing comment, the composer automatically nests the new comment under the selected one and displays a visual hierarchy (e.g., inset or indentation).\n   - IF the user clicks \"Comment\" at the top of the list or does not select any reply target, the comment is posted as a top-level comment.\n4. **The user submits the comment** by clicking the \"Post\" button.\n5. **THE system SHALL immediately display the new comment** in the UI with:\n   - Author display name (or \"Anonymous\" if not set)\n   - Relative timestamp (e.g., \"just now\")\n   - Vote buttons (Up/Down)\n   - \"Edit\" and \"Delete\" buttons visible only to the current user\n   - Reply button available to all authenticated users\n   - Visual nesting (if replying to a nested comment)\n6. **THE system SHALL update the parent comment’s reply count** in real-time (+1), even if the comment is nested multiple levels deep.\n7. **THE system SHALL synchronize the new comment with the server** in the background and handle any failure by:\n   - Preserving the locally displayed comment\n   - Showing a retry indicator (e.g., pulsing \"Posted\" banner)\n   - Allowing the user to manually retry if sync fails\n8. **THE system SHALL ensure that all comments are ordered by creation time within their thread**, following:\n   - NEWEST first at the top of each thread\n   - If comments have identical creation time, the comment with a higher identifier (created later) appears first\n9. **WHEN the user edits a comment they authored**, THE system SHALL:\n   - Display an editable text field with the original content pre-filled\n   - Allow the user to modify up to 2,000 characters\n   - Preserve line breaks and plain text\n   - Hide \"Delete\" button during edit mode\n   - Show \"Save\" and \"Cancel\" buttons\n10. **WHEN the user clicks \"Save\"**, THE system SHALL:\n    - Immediately update the display with the edited text\n    - Update the comment’s \"last edited\" timestamp (displayed as \"edited X min ago\")\n    - Send an update request to the server\n    - If the update fails, preserve the local edit and show a retry prompt\n11. **WHEN the user clicks \"Delete\"** on a comment they authored, THE system SHALL:\n    - Immediately remove the comment from the UI\n    - Decrease the reply count of its parent comment (if any)\n    - Send a deletion request to the server\n    - If deletion fails, restore the comment in the UI and show a retry indicator\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\n#### A1: Comment Length Violation\n\n- IF the user types more than 2,000 characters in the comment composer, THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - Disable the \"Post\" button\n  - Show a red counter (e.g., \"2050/2000\")\n  - Prevent submission until the text is reduced below 2,000 characters\n\n#### A2: Blank Comment Submission\n\n- IF the user clicks \"Post\" with 0 characters or only whitespace, THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - Prevent submission\n  - Show a tooltip: \"Your comment can't be empty. Add some text.\"\n  - Keep the composer open and focused\n\n#### A3: Nested Reply Depth Limit\n\n- WHILE the comment system is displaying reply threads, THE system SHALL limit nesting to a maximum of **5 levels deep**.\n- IF the user tries to reply to a comment that is already at depth 5, THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - Disable the \"Reply\" button on that comment\n  - Show tooltip: \"Replies are limited to 5 levels deep.\"\n  - Allow replies only to comments at depth 4 or shallower\n\n#### A4: Editing Another User’s Comment\n\n- IF the user clicks \"Edit\" on a comment authored by someone else, THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - Immediately show a modal with message: \"You can edit or delete only items you authored.\"\n  - Keep the comment unmodified\n  - Return focus to the comment list\n\n#### A5: Deleting Another User’s Comment\n\n- IF the user clicks \"Delete\" on a comment authored by someone else, THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - Immediately show a modal with message: \"You can edit or delete only items you authored.\"\n  - Keep the comment unchanged\n  - Return focus to the comment list\n\n#### A6: Session Expires During Comment Interaction\n\n- WHILE the user is composing or editing a comment, IF the JWT session expires:\n  - THEN THE system SHALL:\n    - Display a light modal overlay: \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n    - Disable the \"Post\", \"Save\", or \"Delete\" buttons\n    - Preserve the unsaved comment text in local memory\n    - Allow the user to initiate login\n  - WHEN the user successfully logs in:\n    - THE system SHALL restore the comment text to the composer\n    - Re-enable all comment action buttons\n    - Resume the original action (post/save/delete)\n\n#### A7: Comment Search Triggered\n\n- IF the user performs a global search (`/s`) and selects the \"Comments\" tab:\n  - THEN THE system SHALL:\n    - Return comment snippets sorted by \"Newest\" only\n    - Display each result as:\n      - Comment content (max 2 lines, truncated with ellipsis)\n      - Author name\n      - Relative timestamp\n      - Parent post title (clickable link)\n      - Community name\n    - Show \"Load more\" to fetch next 20 results\n    - If no results, display: \"No matching results. Try different keywords.\"\n\n#### A8: Comment Visibility on Home Feed\n\n- IF the comment is linked from a post that appears in the Home feed (e.g., from \"Global Latest\" sidebar):\n  - THEN THE system SHALL NOT display comments inline in the Home feed card\n  - Instead, THE system SHALL include only:\n    - Comment count\n    - Score (upvotes - downvotes) of the parent post\n  - Full comments are only viewable on the post detail page (`/c/[name]/[postID]`)\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\n1. **Positive Outcome**: The comment is successfully posted, edited, or deleted, with immediate visual feedback. The user gains confidence in their ability to participate and influence conversations.\n2. **Persistence**: Even if the server fails to synchronize, the user’s input is preserved locally and can be retried, ensuring no loss of work.\n3. **Ownership Reinforcement**: The \"Edit\" and \"Delete\" buttons are only shown when appropriate, reinforcing the business rule that users own their content.\n4. **Thread Integrity**: Nested replies remain properly organized, aiding readability, and reply counts are always accurate.\n5. **Experience Consistency**: All comment interactions follow the same pattern as voting and joining: optimistic UI updates, server sync in background, and graceful error recovery.\n6. **Discovery Enabled**: Searchable comments increase content discoverability, allowing users to find relevant discussions even outside their joined communities.\n7. **No Self-Reference**: Comments cannot be voted on by their own author — this rule is enforced both in UI (voting buttons grayed out) and backend.\n\n### Business Rules Summary (EARS Format)\n\n- THE system SHALL allow only authenticated users to create, edit, or delete comments.\n- WHEN a comment is submitted, THE system SHALL validate that its length is between 2 and 2,000 characters.\n- WHILE a user is editing a comment they authored, THE system SHALL allow changes to the text content but prevent editing of any other comment.\n- IF a user attempts to edit or delete a comment not authored by them, THEN THE system SHALL display \"You can edit or delete only items you authored.\"\n- WHERE a comment is posted as a reply to another comment, THE system SHALL visually nest it one level deeper and increment the parent’s reply count.\n- IF the maximum comment nesting depth (5 levels) is reached, THEN THE system SHALL disable \"Reply\" buttons on all comments at depth 5.\n- WHEN session expires during comment interaction, THE system SHALL pause all editing actions, preserve local draft, and resume full functionality after successful re-authentication.\n- THE system SHALL store and display the relative timestamp of each comment in the user’s local timezone (Asia/Seoul), using format such as \"just now\", \"X minutes ago\", or \"X days ago\".\n- THE system SHALL prevent users from upvoting or downvoting their own comments.\n- WHERE the global search is executed with \"Comments\" selected, THE system SHALL return comments sorted exclusively by \"Newest\", and display 20 items per page.\n- THE system SHALL never display comment content in the Home feed or Global Latest sidebar — only the comment count is included.\n\n### Behavior Constraints\n\n- **Text Formatting**: All comments must be plain text only — HTML, markdown, script tags, or code blocks are prohibited and stripped during submission.\n- **Whitespaces**: Trailing/leading whitespace in comment text is preserved in display but ignored for length calculation (i.e., \"   \" counts as 0 valid characters).\n- **Replies**: A comment can have multiple direct replies, but each reply thread is linear and independent. No \"side-thread\" branching is allowed.\n- **Vote System**: Comment votes are independent of post votes — a comment’s score is calculated separately as (upvotes − downvotes) and does not affect the parent post’s score.\n- **Deletion**: Deleting a comment also deletes all replies nested under it (cascade delete).\n- **Updates**: Editing a comment does not change its creation timestamp — only the \"last edited\" timestamp is updated.\n\n### Ui Optimism and Sync\n\n- All comment creation, editing, and deletion are treated as optisimistic actions:\n  - UI updates occur immediately upon user action\n  - Server sync occurs in background with separate HTTP request\n  - If sync fails, UI state is preserved and retry mechanism is exposed (e.g., \"Retry\" button)\n- This ensures the experience remains responsive and smooth, even under poor network conditions.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

This user understands that their votes influence content visibility and are part of a collaborative knowledge-weighting system. They expect immediate, visible feedback on their actions and clarity when actions are restricted.\n\n**Guest (Unauthenticated User)**\n\nA visitor to the platform who reads content but has not signed in. They may be considering joining the community and observe voting behavior as a signal of content quality. They encounter system prompts when attempting to interact and are guided toward registration.\n\n**Admin (System Moderator)**\n\nAn elevated user who can override content restrictions, delete inappropriate items, and manage communities. Admins possess the same voting privileges as members but may vote on content they did not create even if they are the author of another item — they are treated like any other member for voting purposes unless otherwise governed by moderation overrides.\n\n### Goal Statement\n\nUsers should be able to express their opinion on any post or comment with a single, intuitive action (clicking Upvote or Downvote), experience immediate visual feedback, and understand why they cannot vote in certain situations — all within a seamless, frictionless flow that preserves their current context.\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n- The user is viewing a post or comment item in any page context: Home feed, Community Home, Post Detail, or Search results.\n- The item has an active upvote/downvote interface (visible buttons: ▲ for upvote, ▼ for downvote).\n- The user’s session state is either active or expired (will be handled by recovery flow).\n- The user is either a guest or a member, as defined by 01-user-roles.md.\n- The user is not attempting to vote on their own content.\n- Content exists and has not been removed.\n\n### Main Success Scenario\n\n**Scenario: Member Upvotes a Post**\n\n1. The member views a post in the Home feed authored by another user.\n2. The member clicks the ▲ (Upvote) button.\n3. THE system SHALL immediately (optimistically) update the UI:\n   - The ▲ button changes color to indicate \"upvoted\" state (e.g., blue fill).\n   - The ▼ button becomes unhighlighted.\n   - The score indicator increases by 1 (e.g., from \"2\" to \"3\").\n   - The vote count tooltip or badge refreshes visually without page reload.\n4. Meanwhile, the system sends a vote registration request to the backend.\n5. THE system SHALL validate:\n   - The user is not the author of the post (via ownership check).\n   - The vote state transition is permitted (None → Upvote).\n6. IF validation passes, THE system SHALL:\n   - Persist the upvote in the backend database.\n   - Return a 200 OK response.\n   - Lock the vote state for this user on this item until changed.\n7. THE system SHALL maintain consistent UI state matching backend state.\n8. IF the vote succeeds, the member feels validated: their input had immediate global effect.\n\n**Scenario: Member Toggles from Upvote to Downvote**\n\n1. The member has previously upvoted a comment.\n2. The member clicks the ▼ (Downvote) button.\n3. THE system SHALL immediately update the UI:\n   - The ▲ button returns to neutral state (empty outline).\n   - The ▼ button changes to \"downvoted\" state (e.g., red fill).\n   - The score indicator decreases by 2 (e.g., from \"5\" to \"3\", since it removes +1 and adds -1).\n4. THE system SHALL send a vote update request (Upvote → Downvote).\n5. IF the backend accepts the transition, THE system SHALL update the vote record to reflect the new state.\n\n**Scenario: Member Reverses Vote to None**\n\n1. The member has upvoted a post and wishes to remove their vote.\n2. The member clicks the ▲ (Upvote) button again.\n3. THE system SHALL immediately update the UI:\n   - The ▲ button returns to neutral (empty outline).\n   - The ▼ button remains neutral (empty outline).\n   - The score indicator decreases by 1 (e.g., from \"4\" to \"3\").\n4. THE system SHALL send a vote removal request (Upvote → None).\n5. IF the backend accepts, THE system SHALL clear the user’s vote record for that item.\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\n**Scenario: Guest Attempts to Vote**\n\n1. A guest user clicks ▲ on a post.\n2. THE system SHALL immediately halt the action.\n3. THE system SHALL display a modal overlay: \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n4. The modal contains:\n   - Login form (email/username + password)\n   - \"Sign up\" option\n5. IF the guest logs in successfully:\n   - THE system SHALL resume the original voting action without requiring the user to navigate back.\n   - The vote is submitted as if initiated after login.\n6. IF the guest closes the modal:\n   - THE system SHALL return the UI to its pre-click state.\n   - The vote UI remains unchanged.\n\n**Scenario: Member Attempts to Vote on Own Post**\n\n1. A member views their own post.\n2. The member clicks ▲ or ▼.\n3. THE system SHALL:\n   - Immediately prevent the action.\n   - Display an inline message below the vote buttons: \"You can’t vote on your own posts/comments.\"\n   - Keep the vote buttons unchanged (no state transition).\n4. THE system SHALL NOT send a request to the backend.\n5. No server-side validation occurs — the restriction is enforced client-side as a UX best practice.\n\n**Scenario: Member Clicks Upvote, Then Downvote, Then Upvote Again (Cycle)**\n\n1. Member starts with No vote (score = 0).\n2. Member clicks ▲ → score becomes +1. Vote state = Upvote.\n3. Member clicks ▼ → score becomes -1. Vote state = Downvote.\n4. Member clicks ▲ → score becomes +1. Vote state = Upvote.\n5. THE system SHALL permit this cycle indefinitely.\n6. Each click SHALL trigger optimistic UI update.\n7. Each change SHALL trigger one backend update request.\n\n**Scenario: Session Expires During Voting Attempt**\n\n1. Member has been inactive for 30 days (session expired).\n2. Member clicks ▲ on a post.\n3. THE system SHALL:\n   - Detect invalid or expired JWT.\n   - Hide any pending vote state.\n   - Display the login modal with message: \"Your session has expired. Please log in to continue.\"\n4. IF member logs in successfully:\n   - THE system SHALL reinstate the voting intention.\n   - THE system SHALL send the vote action immediately after authentication.\n5. IF member cancels login:\n   - THE system SHALL return UI to neutral state.\n   - The vote action is abandoned.\n\n**Scenario: Community Admin Votes on Their Own Post**\n\n1. An admin user creates a post.\n2. Admin clicks ▲ on their own post.\n3. THE system SHALL:\n   - Treat the admin as a member in this context.\n   - Prevent the vote.\n   - Display: \"You can’t vote on your own posts/comments.\"\n4. Admin cannot override this restriction — even admins are subject to ownership rules for voting.\n\n**Scenario: Invalid State Transition Attempt (e.g., Clicking Upvote Twice)**\n\n1. User has already upvoted a post.\n2. User clicks Upvote button again.\n3. THE system SHALL behave identically to \"Reversing Vote to None\" (Scenario in Main).\n4. No error condition is triggered — this is the standard, expected behavior.\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\n- **Immediate outcome**: The user’s vote state is visually reflected on the item card or comment thread, with score updated without delay.\n- **Persistent outcome**: The vote is recorded in the backend and counts toward the item’s final score for sorting (Newest, Top).\n- **Downstream effect**: The item’s position in the Home feed (sorted by Top) may rise or fall in subsequent paginated loads, based on updated score.\n- **Data integrity**: The system prevents vote inflation — a single user contributes only one vote per item at a time.\n- **User satisfaction**: Users perceive the system as responsive and consistent. No confusion arises over why a vote disappeared — the state change is transparent.\n- **Session recovery**: If the user leaves and returns later, the vote state is preserved (if session is active) or must be re-established after login.\n- **Moderation alignment**: The vote behavior reinforces community consensus, not authority — even admins are bound by the same rule against self-voting.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Vote State Machine\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n  [*] --> \"No Vote\"\n  \"No Vote\" --> \"Upvote\": Click Upvote\n  \"No Vote\" --> \"Downvote\": Click Downvote\n  \"Upvote\" --> \"No Vote\": Click Upvote\n  \"Upvote\" --> \"Downvote\": Click Downvote\n  \"Downvote\" --> \"No Vote\": Click Downvote\n  \"Downvote\" --> \"Upvote\": Click Upvote\n```\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

They may be new to the platform and seeking topics aligned with their interests, or an existing member looking for specific posts, communities, or comments. This user understands the platform’s structure and expects intuitive, predictable behavior when performing searches. They rely on the search function as their primary tool for content discovery beyond curated feeds.\n\n### Goal Statement\n\nThe Search Explorer wants to find relevant posts, sub-communities, or comments across the platform using keywords. They need to see accurate, filtered, and sorted results quickly, with clear feedback when no results exist or when their query is too short. Their goal is to navigate the platform efficiently without confusion or frustration.\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n- The user is either authenticated (member) or unauthenticated (guest).\n- The user has navigated to the `/s` page from any other page in the application.\n- The global navigation bar is visible, with the search input pre-focused.\n- The user has entered 0 or more characters into the search input field.\n- The user has not yet initiated a search or has initiated an invalid search.\n\n### Main Success Scenario\n\n1. WHEN a user types at least 2 characters into the global search bar (e.g., \"ai\" or \"gaming\"), THE system SHALL automatically trigger a search request after a 300ms debounce period or when the user submits the form.\n2. THE system SHALL return results organized into three tabbed panels: Posts, Sub-Communities, and Comments.\n3. THE Posts tab SHALL be selected by default.\n4. THE system SHALL sort results by Newest, as per the default sort rule.\n5. THE system SHALL render exactly 20 results per tab.\n6. WHEN results are displayed:\n   - FOR Posts, THE system SHALL show: community name, post title, excerpt of body (max 2 lines, truncated with ellipsis), author display name (or \"Anonymous\"), relative time, comment count, and vote score (upvotes minus downvotes).\n   - FOR Sub-Communities, THE system SHALL show: community name, description (max 2 lines, truncated with ellipsis), community logo (if present, otherwise default), and a Join / Joined toggle button (visible and interactive only if user is authenticated).\n   - FOR Comments, THE system SHALL show: raw comment content (max 2 lines, truncated with ellipsis), author display name (or \"Anonymous\"), relative time, parent post title (clickable link), and community name.\n7. THE system SHALL display a [Load more] button at the bottom of the result list in each tab.\n8. WHEN the user clicks [Load more], THE system SHALL load and append the next 20 results without reloading the page.\n9. WHEN the user toggles between tabs (Posts, Sub-Communities, Comments), THE system SHALL immediately refresh the results for the selected tab.\n10. WHEN the user selects the Sub-Communities tab, THE system SHALL:\n   - Set the default sort order to Name Match (highest relevance to the query).\n   - Use creation date (newest first) as a fallback sort if name match scores are equal.\n11. WHEN the user selects the Comments tab, THE system SHALL:\n   - Fix the sort order to Newest.\n   - Hide the sort dropdown control.\n12. THE search query SHALL persist in the input field and SHALL remain editable to refine results.\n\n### Alternative Scenarios\n\n#### A. Query Too Short (Less than 2 characters)\n\n- WHEN a user types fewer than 2 characters (e.g., \"a\" or \"c\"), THE system SHALL display a persistent placeholder below the input field: \"Please enter at least 2 characters.\"\n- THEN THE system SHALL NOT execute any search or return any results.\n- THEN THE system SHALL NOT update any tab content.\n- WHERE the input is empty or contains exactly one character, THE system SHALL keep the placeholder visible until the user enters two or more characters.\n\n#### B. No Results Found\n\n- WHEN a search query returns zero results for a specific tab (e.g., searching for \"xyz123\" for comments), THE system SHALL display a centered, empty-state message under the tab header: \"No matching results. Try different keywords.\"\n- THEN THE system SHALL hide the [Load more] button for that tab.\n- THEN THE system SHALL preserve the search query in the input field.\n- THEN THE system SHALL show empty tab content but retain tab navigation functionality.\n- THEN THE system SHALL NOT affect results in other tabs.\n\n#### C. Guest User Searches\n\n- WHILE the user is unauthenticated (guest), THE system SHALL show the same results for Posts, Sub-Communities, and Comments as an authenticated member.\n- THEN THE system SHALL display the Join button as disabled and grayed-out for all sub-community cards.\n- THEN THE system SHALL show a tooltip on hover: \"Sign in to join this community.\"\n- THEN THE system SHALL allow all search interactions and result viewing without interruption.\n\n#### D. Member Joins After Searching (Optimistic UI)\n\n- WHEN a user is logged in and clicks Join on a sub-community card in the Sub-Communities tab, THE system SHALL immediately change the button text to \"Joined\" and disable it.\n- THEN THE system SHALL NOT wait for server response to update the UI.\n- WHERE the operation succeeds later, THE system SHALL maintain the \"Joined\" state.\n- WHERE the operation fails, THE system SHALL revert the button state to \"Join\" and show: \"A temporary error occurred. Please try again in a moment.\"\n\n#### E. Session Expired During Search\n\n- WHILE the user is actively performing a search, IF the authentication token expires during request, THE system SHALL show a non-intrusive overlay modal: \"Please sign in to continue.\"\n- THEN THE system SHALL pause the search flow but preserve the current query.\n- THEN THE system SHALL NOT reload the page.\n- WHEN the user successfully authenticates in the modal, THE system SHALL resume the search request with the same query and return to the same tab.\n\n#### F. Selecting a Different Sort Order - Posts Tab\n\n- WHEN the user selects [Top] from the sort dropdown on the Posts tab, THE system SHALL sort results by:\n   - Primary: Highest score (upvotes minus downvotes) descending\n   - Secondary: Most recent creation time (newest first)\n   - Tertiary: Largest post identifier (highest numeric ID)\n- THEN THE system SHALL immediately update the result list with sorted results.\n- THEN THE system SHALL update the button label to reflect the selected order.\n\n#### G. Selecting a Different Sort Order - Sub-Communities Tab\n\n- WHEN the user selects [Recently Created] from the sort dropdown on the Sub-Communities tab, THE system SHALL sort results by:\n   - Primary: Creation date (newest first)\n   - Secondary: Name match score (if creation dates are equal)\n- THEN THE system SHALL immediately update the result list.\n- THEN THE system SHALL update the button label to reflect the selected order.\n\n#### H. Search with Special Characters\n\n- WHEN a user enters a query with punctuation, emojis, or symbols (e.g., \"how to fix 🐞\", \"C++\" or \"AI:2025\"), THE system SHALL treat the entire query as a free-text string for matching.\n- THEN THE system SHALL search for substring matches in titles, bodies, and descriptions (case-insensitive).\n- THEN THE system SHALL ignore special characters for stemming or tokenization.\n- THEN THE system SHALL NOT require exact phrase matches unless enclosed in quotes (which are not supported).\n\n### Post-action Outcomes\n\n- The user either:\n   - Found desired content and navigated to a post, comment, or community — continuing their journey.\n   - Got no results and refined their query — indicating an opportunity to improve keyword suggestions or community indexing.\n   - Did not enter enough characters — experience was clear and guiding.\n- THE system SHALL maintain consistent behavior across authentication states.\n- THE user’s search intent SHALL be met without interruption, confusion, or technical failure.\n- THE UI SHALL remain responsive and continue to use relative timestamps (e.g., \"2 minutes ago\"), localized to Asia/Seoul timezone.\n- THE system’s search index SHALL be updated in the background with the latest content, without requiring user action.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

This table\npersists the immutable role definitions that govern platform behavior,\nsuch as who can create communities, post content, or moderate\ntransactions. Referenced by user tables to enforce access control\npolicies.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `role_name`\n  > The precise role identifier that defines the permission set. Must be one\n  > of: 'guest', 'member', or 'admin'. This value is immutable and used to\n  > enforce access control rules throughout the system.\n- `description`\n  > A human-readable description of the role's permissions and\n  > responsibilities within the platform.

This table enforces that all operations\nrequiring authentication are blocked at the data layer, and no\nuser-specific state is persisted. Used to prevent unauthorized access to\nwrite operations.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `created_at`\n  > Timestamp when the guest session began. This field tracks access time for\n  > analytics but does not store persistent user state.\n- `ip_address`\n  > IP address of the guest user. Used for analytics and spam detection. Not\n  > used for authentication.\n\n### `community_platform_member`\n\nMember account entity that represents authenticated users with full\nparticipation rights including posting, commenting, voting, and joining\ncommunities. This table stores authentication credentials and user\npreferences. Member accounts own all content they create and can\nedit/delete only their own content.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `email`\n  > User's email address used for authentication and communication.

Admins inherit all\nmember privileges and can override content ownership restrictions. This\ntable ensures admin privileges are isolated and auditable, with admin\nrole enforced server-side.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `member_id`\n  > Reference to the underlying member account. Admin is a privilege level\n  > granted to an existing member. [community_platform_member.id](#community_platform_member).\n- `created_at`\n  > Timestamp when admin privileges were granted.

Communities have unique names, categories, and optional metadata\nlike description, rules, logo, and banner. Member count is tracked in\nreal-time. Communities are created by members and can be deleted by\nadmins or creators. All community data is immutable except for\ndescription, logo, banner, and rules (by creator).\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `name`\n  > Unique alphanumeric identifier for the community. May contain hyphens (-)\n  > and underscores (_). Must be 5 to 64 characters long. Immutable after\n  > creation.\n- `category`\n  > The predefined category this community belongs to. Must be one of: [\"Tech\n  > & Programming\", \"Science\", \"Movies & TV\", \"Games\", \"Sports\", \"Lifestyle &\n  > Wellness\", \"Study & Education\", \"Art & Design\", \"Business & Finance\",\n  > \"News & Current Affairs\"].\n- `description`\n  > Optional summary text with a maximum length of 500 characters. Describes\n  > the community's purpose and rules.\n- `rules`\n  > Optional community rules in plain text format. Each rule is one line. Up\n  > to 20 rules allowed. Only the top 5 are displayed on UI.\n- `logo_url`\n  > URL to the community's logo image. Supports PNG, JPG, SVG formats.\n  > Optional. Defaults to placeholder if not provided.\n- `banner_url`\n  > URL to the community's banner image. Supports PNG, JPG formats. Optional.\n  > Defaults to placeholder if not provided.\n- `member_count`\n  > Current number of users who have joined this community. Updated in\n  > real-time when users join or leave. Displayed as \"1k\" for ≥1000, \"1m\" for\n  > ≥1000000.\n- `created_at`\n  > Timestamp when this community was created.

Posts are\ntext-only with title and body, linked to a community and author.\nOwnership is account-based: only the author can edit or delete. Cascading\ndelete on community removal. Created_at and updated_at track lifecycle;\ndeleted_at enables soft delete. Comment count and score are maintained in\nseparate post_stats table; no denormalized counts here to ensure 3NF\ncompliance.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `community_id`\n  > Community to which this post belongs. {@link\n  > community_platform_communities.id}.\n- `author_id`: Member who authored this post. [community_platform_member.id](#community_platform_member).\n- `title`\n  > Post title. Must be between 5 and 120 characters. Plain text only, no\n  > HTML or formatting.\n- `body`\n  > Post body content. Must be between 10 and 10,000 characters. Plain text\n  > with \\n line breaks only, no scripts or executable content.\n- `author_display_name`\n  > Optional display name for the author. If empty or null, system displays\n  > \"Anonymous\". Maximum 32 characters.\n- `created_at`: Timestamp when the post was created. Always set on creation.\n- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the post was last updated. Updated on each edit.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Soft delete timestamp. If null, post is active. If set, post is deleted\n  > and hidden from feeds.\n\n### `community_platform_comments`\n\nNested comments on posts or other comments. Each comment has a single\nparent (post or comment) and is authored by a member. Comments support\nunlimited nesting, ordered by creation time. Only the author can\nedit/delete. Soft delete supported via deleted_at. All content is plain\ntext. Comment counts are stored in separate comment_stats table to\nmaintain normalization. This is a primary entity because users require\nindependent comment management: search by user, moderation workflows,\ncross-post visibility.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `post_id`\n  > Post that this comment belongs to. CASCADE DELETE when post is removed.\n  > [community_platform_posts.id](#community_platform_posts).\n- `author_id`: Member who authored this comment. [community_platform_member.id](#community_platform_member).\n- `parent_id`\n  > Parent comment this comment replies to. Self-referential relationship. If\n  > null, comment is top-level (directly under post). {@link\n  > community_platform_comments.id}.\n- `content`\n  > Full text content of the comment. Must be between 2 and 2,000 characters.\n  > Plain text with \\n line breaks only. No HTML, code, or executable content\n  > permitted.\n- `created_at`: Timestamp when the comment was created. Always set on creation.\n- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the comment was last updated. Updated on each edit.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Soft delete timestamp. If null, comment is active. If set, comment is\n  > deleted and hidden from views.\n\n## Votes\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n\"community_platform_post_votes\" {\n  String id PK\n  String community_platform_post_id FK\n  String community_platform_user_id FK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime updated_at\n  String vote_state\n}\n\"community_platform_comment_votes\" {\n  String id PK\n  String community_platform_comment_id FK\n  String community_platform_user_id FK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime updated_at\n  String vote_state\n}\n```\n\n### `community_platform_post_votes`\n\nTracks individual upvotes and downvotes by users on posts. Each record\nrepresents a single vote from a user on a specific post, enforcing\nuniqueness to ensure one vote per user per post. The vote state can be\nupvote, downvote, or none (implicitly tracked by the absence of a\nrecord). This empowers efficient score calculation (upvotes - downvotes)\nand prevents self-voting through foreign key constraints to\ncommunity_platform_posts.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `community_platform_post_id`: The post that was voted on. [community_platform_posts.id](#community_platform_posts).\n- `community_platform_user_id`: The user who cast this vote. [community_platform_member.id](#community_platform_member).\n- `created_at`\n  > The timestamp when the vote was cast. Used for ordering and determining\n  > vote age.\n- `updated_at`\n  > The timestamp when the vote was last updated (e.g., changed from upvote\n  > to downvote).\n- `vote_state`\n  > The current state of the vote ('upvote' or 'downvote').
