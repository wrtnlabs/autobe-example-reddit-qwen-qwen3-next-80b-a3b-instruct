   * Retrieve a specific comment by ID within a post.

   * This operation retrieves a specific comment by its unique identifier within

   * to a specific post within a specific community. This endpoint provides
   * detailed comment information including content, author display name,
   * creation timestamp, and parent-child relationships. This functionality
   * enables users to link directly to individual comments for reference or
   * sharing.
   *
   * Security considerations dictate that this operation requires
   * authentication. Any authenticated user (member or administrator) can
   * retrieve comments from communities they have access to. The system enforces
   * that comments must belong to the specified post and community, with
   * appropriate foreign key relations enforced at the database level. Guests
   * cannot access these private resources.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the communitybbs_comment table as defined in
   * the Prisma schema, incorporating all available comment fields including
   * content, display_name, created_at, updated_at, and the parent-child
   * relationship through communitybbs_comment_id. The response includes the
   * full comment data optimized for display in the UI, with relationships to
   * the parent post and associated community.
   *
   * Validation rules ensure that the commentId, postId, and communityId form a
   * valid relationship. If the comment does not exist, belong to the specified
   * post, or belongs to a different community, a 404 response is returned.
   * There are no rate limits on this endpoint to enable seamless user
   * navigation, but the system enforces ownership and relationship integrity
   * through the database schema.
   *
   * Related API operations include retrieving all comments for a post (PATCH
   * /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}/comments) and creating new
   * comments (POST /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}/comments). This
   * 'at' operation is typically used after searching or navigating to a

   * content length restrictions as defined in business requirements (2-2000
   * characters). This endpoint enables users to correct typos or improve
   * comment content after submission.
   *
   * Security considerations mandate that only the original author of a comment
   * can modify it. The system enforces ownership verification through the
   * communitybbs_member_id relationship. If a user attempts to update a comment
   * they did not author, the system returns a forbidden response with the
   * message 'You can edit or delete only items you authored.' This protection
   * prevents unauthorized modification of others' content.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the communitybbs_comment table as defined in
   * the Prisma schema. The request payload includes the updated comment content
   * and optional display name. The response returns the updated comment entity
   * including its updated_at timestamp, which is automatically set by the
   * service layer. The updated_at field ensures clients receive the latest
   * update information for optimal UI consistency.
   *
   * Validation rules strictly enforce the content length requirement: comments
   * must be at least 2 characters long and no more than 2,000 characters. If
   * the content violates these constraints, the system returns a 400 Bad
   * Request error with the message 'Comment must be between 2 and 2,000
   * characters.' The system also validates the comment exists, belongs to the
   * specified post, and belongs to the specified community before processing
   * the update.

   * administrator. This endpoint implements hard deletion as there is no
   * deleted_at field in the schema, removing the comment completely from the
   * database.
   *
   * Per the Prisma schema, the communitybbs_comment table does not include a
   * deleted_at field, indicating that deletion is permanent rather than soft
   * deletion. When a comment is deleted, all associated data is removed from
   * the database, including its relationships to votes and parent-child
   * relationships. There is no recovery mechanism.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict ownership verification. Only the
   * original author of a comment or an administrator can delete a comment. If
   * an unauthorized user attempts deletion, the system returns a 403 Forbidden
   * response with the message 'You can edit or delete only items you authored.'
   * This ensures content integrity and prevents unauthorized removal of user
   * content.
   *
   * The system follows the business requirement that comments can be deleted by
