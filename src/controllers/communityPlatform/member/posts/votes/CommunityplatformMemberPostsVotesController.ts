  /**
   * Set or toggle a user's vote state on a specific post.
   *
   * Creates or updates a user's vote state for a specific post. It interacts
   * with the community_platform_post_votes table and handles the business logic
   * of vote state transitions according to the required model: None → Upvote →
   * Downvote → None. If the user already has a vote on this post, the operation
   * toggles the state. The transaction is implemented with optimistic UI
   * updates, where the interface immediately reflects the new state before
   * server confirmation. This single endpoint handles all possible state
   * changes, avoiding redundancy and complexity. The operation is designed to
   * be idempotent, allowing users to rapidly toggle between vote states without
   * race conditions.
   *
   * The operation targets the community_platform_post_votes table as defined in
   * the Prisma schema, which enforces a unique constraint on the combination of
   * community_platform_post_id and community_platform_user_id to ensure each
   * user can have only one vote per post. This table contains fields for id,
   * community_platform_post_id, community_platform_user_id, created_at,
   * updated_at, and vote_state. The unique constraint automatically handles the
   * complexity of toggling between vote states as the application logic must
   * first determine the existing state and then either update or create a new
   * record accordingly.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict ownership validation to prevent
   * users from voting on their own content. The system checks the author_id of
   * the post against the authenticated user's ID (contained in the JWT) before
   * allowing any vote. If a user attempts to vote on their own post, the
   * operation will fail with a 403 response, and the display will show 'You
   * can't vote on your own posts/comments.' as specified in the business
   * requirements. This protection is enforced at both the API level and
   * database level through this operational check.
   *
   * This operation supports the core functionality of the post voting system,
   * where users can upvote or downvote content to influence its visibility in
   * the "Top" sort order. The vote state transitions follow these rules
   * exactly:
   *
   * 1. None → Upvote (when Upvote button clicked and no previous vote)
   * 2. None → Downvote (when Downvote button clicked and no previous vote)
   * 3. Upvote → None (when Upvote button clicked again)
   * 4. Downvote → None (when Downvote button clicked again)
   * 5. Upvote → Downvote (when Downvote button clicked while upvoted)
   * 6. Downvote → Upvote (when Upvote button clicked while downvoted)
   *
   * This operation is directly linked to the community_platform_post_votes
   * table and related tables like community_platform_post_stats, which
   * maintains a denormalized count of the overall post score. When a vote is
   * created or updated, this statistic is updated atomically to ensure
   * high-performance sorting in the "Top" feed without requiring real-time
   * joins or aggregations.
   *
   * Related API operations include the entertainment of vote state through the
   * optimistic UI without requiring retrieval, as the UI state is authoritative
   * and should mirror user action. POST /votes is the only permitted
   * interaction for vote state change. No retrieval or deletion endpoints are
   * needed.
   *
   * The response returns no body, as the optimistic UI update will display the
   * new score immediately.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the post to vote on
   * @param body Details for the vote action to perform. Should include the
   *   desired vote state: 'upvote' or 'downvote'. The system will determine
   *   whether to create a new vote record or update the existing one based on
   *   the current state and the requested state. This follows the business rule
   *   that users can toggle between states but cannot vote when not
   *   authenticated or when voting on their own post.

  /**
   * Retrieve the current vote state for a post.
   *
   * This operation retrieves the current vote state for a post by executing a
   * search on the community_platform_post_votes table. It requires the user to
   * send a PATCH request with a requestBody containing submission parameters
   * that identify the post ID and optionally, filtering criteria such as user
   * identification. The operation returns the user's current voting state
   * (upvote, downvote, or none) in the response body. This rather than GET, as
   * it handles complex state retrieval with dynamic parameters. This operation
   * demonstrates that collection searches with dynamic parameters must use
   * PATCH method rather than GET, even when no data modification occurs.
   *
   * The operation targets the community_platform_post_votes table as defined in
   * the Prisma schema, which contains the user's vote state (upvote or
   * downvote) for each post. Since the voting system does not store a 'none'
   * state explicitly (absence of record implies 'none'), this endpoint must
   * determine whether the current user has voted on the specific post by
   * checking for the existence of a record where community_platform_post_id
   * matches the postId and community_platform_user_id matches the authenticated
   * user's ID.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring that only authenticated users can
   * check their own vote state. Unauthorized users cannot query vote states of
   * other users. The system verifies the user's authentication token before
   * executing the search. This follows the business rule that users can only
   * access their own voting data.
   *
   * This operation is directly linked to the community_platform_post_votes
   * table as defined in the Prisma schema, which includes fields for id,
   * community_platform_post_id, community_platform_user_id, created_at,
   * updated_at, and vote_state. The operation searches for records matching the
   * post ID and the authenticated user ID. If a record is found, the vote_state
   * field indicates the current state; if no record exists, the response
   * indicates 'none'.
   *
   * This operation supports pagination and search parameters to handle complex
   * filtering scenarios, though for this use case, the primary parameter is the
   * post identification. The response body structure is defined to return the
   * user's vote state for this specific post. This differs from the POST method
   * on the same endpoint, which is used to create or update votes, whereas this
   * PATCH method is solely for querying state.
   *
   * Related API operations include POST /posts/{postId}/votes to cast a vote
   * and DELETE /posts/{postId}/votes to remove a vote. This operation is
   * critical for implementing the optimistic UI update pattern, where the UI
   * must know the current vote state before allowing a user to toggle their
   * vote. The functionality enables a seamless user experience where clicking a
   * vote button shows the correct current state immediately without needing to
   * refresh the page.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the post for which to retrieve the vote
   *   state
   * @param body Optional parameters for filtering the vote state result. The
   *   only required parameter is the user authentication context, which is
   *   provided through the API token. Additional parameters could include
   *   pagination or search filters if the system were designed to return
   *   multiple vote states, but in this implementation, the vote state is
   *   specifically for one post and one user.

  /**
   * Remove a user's vote on a specific post.
   *
   * This operation removes a user's vote on a specific post by deleting the
   * corresponding record from the community_platform_post_votes table. Unlike
   * toggling votes with POST, this operation explicitly removes the user's vote
   * state, setting it to 'none' without requiring a new vote action. It targets
   * the same table as other vote operations but is designed specifically for
   * vote clearance, supporting the behavior where users can click a button to
   * remove their vote entirely.
   *
   * The operation targets the community_platform_post_votes table as defined in
   * the Prisma schema, which tracks individual upvotes and downvotes with a
   * unique constraint ensuring one vote per user per post. When this delete
   * operation is executed, the system removes the record where
   * community_platform_post_id matches the postId and
   * community_platform_user_id matches the authenticated user's ID. If no such
   * record exists, the operation succeeds as a no-op, since 'none' is the
   * implicit state.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring that only the authenticated user
   * can remove their own vote. This is enforced by checking the authentication
   * token against the user ID stored in the vote record. Users cannot remove
   * votes from other users' posts or from posts they haven't voted on. This
   * follows the business rule that users can only manipulate their own voting
   * state.
   *
   * This operation complements the POST voting creation/update endpoint by
   * providing a more explicit and direct method to clear a vote. While the POST
   * method can achieve vote removal by toggling from an existing state, this
   * DELETE endpoint offers a cleaner semantic for users who specifically want
   * to remove their vote without changing it to the alternative state. The
   * system will update the denormalized community_platform_post_stats table
   * atomically to reflect the removal of the vote and recalculate the post's
   * score (upvotes - downvotes).
   *
   * This operation is linked directly to the community_platform_post_votes
   * table and is part of a complete vote lifecycle management system that
   * includes POST (create/update), PATCH (retrieve), and DELETE (remove). The
   * delete operation supports the requirement that users can toggle their vote
   * state, but in this case, the transition is from Upvote/Downvote → None,
   * bypassing the alternative state. This operation is used by the UI when a
   * user clicks 'Undo Vote' or when default behavior is to remove rather than
   * toggle.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the post from which to remove the user's
