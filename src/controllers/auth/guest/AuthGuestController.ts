   * Creates temporary guest account for read-only access to public content.
   *
   * This API operation generates a temporary guest session for unauthenticated
   * users who wish to browse public content on the community platform. The
   * guest account enables users to view all posts, comments, and communities
   * while restricting access to interactive features like posting, commenting,
   * voting, and community membership—all of which require proper
   * authentication.
   *
   * The operation creates an entry in the community_platform_guest table with a
   * unique UUID identifier and an audit timestamp, capturing the IP address if
   * available for analytics and spam detection purposes. This temporary session
   * does not persist user preferences or account details, ensuring compliance
   * with the platform security model where only authenticated members have
   * persistent identities.
   *
   * This guest session is explicitly designed to align with the business
   * requirement that 'reading is open to everyone' while maintaining the
   * separation between read and write operations. The guest account remains
   * active only for the duration of the session and is not tied to any
   * persistent user state. When the user attempts to perform any privileged
   * action (like joining a community), the system will prompt authentication,
   * and the guest session will be seamlessly replaced with a proper member
   * account.
   *
   * Security is maintained by ensuring the guest account has no permissions
   * beyond read access and cannot be used for any form of content modification.
   * The guest session does not generate tokens that can be used to access any
   * edit or write endpoints, ensuring strict adherence to the requirement that
   * 'ownership is account-based.' The guest joining process is intentionally
   * limited to initiating session-based access without creating an account that
   * persists beyond the current browsing session.
   *
   * This operation must preceded by the user requesting access to the platform
   * and must be followed by any subsequent reads of content. After
   * authentication, the guest session is effectively replaced by a member
   * session, and all previous guest activities are isolated and
   * non-persistent.

  /**
   * Refreshes temporary guest session token to extend read-only access to
   * public content.
   *
   * This API operation extends the validity period of a Guest user session by
   * generating a new access token, enabling continuous read-only access to
   * public content without requiring re-authentication. The refresh operation
   * is essential for maintaining seamless user experience during extended
   * browsing sessions while preserving the security boundary that distinguishes
   * guest (unauthenticated) from member (authenticated) users.
   *
   * The refresh endpoint consumes a valid guest session token—typically
   * acquired via the /auth/guest/join endpoint—and returns a new token pair
   * with updated expiration timestamps. This mechanism allows users to remain
   * in 'read-only' mode for prolonged periods, aligning with the design
   * principle that 'keep the login session generously long.' The system tracks
   * the guest's IP address and timestamps to detect suspicious activity while
   * maintaining user privacy.
   *
   * Because the guest role has no persistent identity or account state, the
   * refresh operation cannot reassign permissions or grant additional
   * privileges. It merely extends the life of the temporary, stateless session.
   * When the user attempts any privileged action (post, comment, vote, join),
   * the system will prompt authentication, at which point the guest session
   * will be terminated and replaced with a member session if credentials are
   * valid.
   *
   * This operation does not affect any user's ability to participate in the
   * platform; it is purely a mechanism for maintaining read-only access to
   * public content. The refresh cycle is governed by the platform's security
   * policies, ensuring that guest sessions do not extend beyond reasonable
   * limits, and does not provide a mechanism to circumvent authentication
   * requirements for interactive features.
