   * Soft delete a community by ID.

   * Soft delete a community by setting the deleted_at field to the current
   * timestamp. The community is marked as archived and hidden from public
   * views. All dependent data (posts, comments, votes, and search indices) are
   * deleted cascadingly. The community record remains in the database for audit
   * purposes with its metadata preserved. This is a hard cascading deletion of
   * related content with soft archiving of the community entity, consistent
   * with the schema design. This operation is only accessible to administrators
   * and is used for content moderation and compliance. It is not a complete
   * hard delete because the community entity is preserved for audit trail, but
   * all user-facing content is permanently removed. The deletion triggers a
   * cascade that removes all communitybbs_post, communitybbs_search_post,
   * communitybbs_search_comment, and communitybbs_log entries linked to this
   * community. A log entry is created in communitybbs_log with action_type =
   * 'community_deleted' to maintain auditability. This operation cannot be
   * undone and must be used with caution. The community name is not made
   * available for reuse to prevent impersonation. Access is restricted to the
   * administrator role with no fallback to other roles for security and
   * compliance reasons.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param communityId Unique identifier of the community to delete.
