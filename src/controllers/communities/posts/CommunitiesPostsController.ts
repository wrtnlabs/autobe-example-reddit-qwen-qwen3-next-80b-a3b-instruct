   * Create a new post in a specified community.
   *
   * Create a new post in the specified community. This operation requires the
   * user to be authenticated as a member and to submit a valid title and body.
   * The title must be between 5 and 120 characters and the body between 10 and
   * 10,000 characters, as per requirements. The body content must be plain text
   * only, with no HTML, scripts, or code allowed — any attempt to include these
   * will be rejected. The author's display name is captured at the time of
   * submission and stored as part of the post for consistency, even if the
   * member later changes their display name. If no display name is provided,
   * the system defaults to 'Anonymous'. The new post is associated with the
   * given community via the communityId path parameter and the authenticated
   * member's ID. Upon successful creation, the community's last_active_at
   * timestamp is updated to the current time, and the post count is incremented
   * internally. The post is immediately available in the community feed and is
   * indexed in the search system. This operation does not require soft delete
   * handling during submission because the post is created in active state
   * only; soft deletion is a permissioned moderation action handled separately.
   * The post is created as a direct user-initiated action, not a
   * system-generated record, and must be trackable to the user who submitted
   * it. This endpoint is protected — guests cannot create posts and will be
   * redirected to login. Only the member role has permission to invoke this
   * endpoint.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param communityId Unique identifier of the community to which the post
   *   will be added.
   * @param body Creation data for a new post, including title, body, and
   *   optional display name.

  /**
   * Search and retrieve paginated posts from a specific community.
   *
   * Retrieve an ordered and paginated list of posts from a specific community,
   * filtered by the provided search criteria. This operation supports advanced
   * filtering using the request body, including sort order (Newest or Top),
   * limit, offset, and text search. For the 'Newest' sort order, results are
   * sorted by creation_time descending, and then by post_id descending for
   * ties. For the 'Top' sort order, results are sorted by score (upvotes minus
   * downvotes) descending, followed by creation_time descending, and finally by
   * post_id descending. The operation only returns posts where deleted_at is
   * null, ensuring archived posts are excluded. The results are constructed by
   * querying the communitybbs_post table, using the communitybbs_community_id
   * as the filter, and joined with the communitybbs_vote table to compute
   * scores using sum conditions. The communitybbs_search_post table is not used
   * here because this endpoint is community-specific and does not require
   * full-text search across the whole platform — instead, it performs standard
   * database queries optimized for range and index scans on the
   * community-specific post set. Pagination is implemented via offset and
   * limit, fetching exactly 20 posts per page as per requirements. This
   * endpoint must be accessible to all authenticated users and reflects the
   * user's joined community state — if the user has not joined the community,
   * the results are still accessible (read-only), matching the public nature of
   * community posts. No role restrictions are needed because posts within
   * communities are publicly readable by design.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param communityId Unique identifier of the community to retrieve posts
   *   from.
   * @param body Search criteria and pagination parameters for filtering posts
   *   within a community. Sort must be one of 'Newest' or 'Top'. Default page
   *   is 1, limit is 20. Supports full-text search on title and body.

   * timestamp, and score (calculated as upvotes minus downvotes). The system
   * verifies that the target post belongs to the specified community and that

   * does not return associated comments — those are available via a separate
   * endpoint at /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}/comments. This
   * endpoint is designed to support public viewability; any user — guest or
   * authenticated — may access a post detail page. The query joins the

   * relationship and with the communitybbs_vote table to compute the score
   * using sum conditions. No user role restrictions are needed because access
   * to post content is public by design, as specified in the requirements. The
