/**
 * Permanently deletes a specific post within a community.
 *
 * This operation permanently deletes a specific post within a community. It
 * operates on the communitybbs_post table from the Prisma schema. The post can
 * only be deleted by its original author or an administrator. This endpoint
 * implements hard deletion as there is no deleted_at field in the schema,
 * removing the post completely from the database along with all associated
 * comments and votes.
 *
 * Per the Prisma schema, the communitybbs_post table does not include a
 * deleted_at field, indicating that deletion is permanent rather than soft
 * deletion. When a post is deleted, all associated data is removed from the
 * database, including all related comments and votes. The deletion cascades
 * automatically through the database foreign key constraints with ON DELETE
 * CASCADE configured. There is no recovery mechanism.
 *
 * Security considerations include strict ownership verification. Only the
 * original author of a post or an administrator can delete a post. If an
 * unauthorized user attempts deletion, the system returns a 403 Forbidden
 * response with the message 'You can edit or delete only items you authored.'
 * This ensures content integrity and prevents unauthorized removal of user
 * content.
 *
 * The system follows the business requirement that posts can be deleted by
 * their authors, but cannot be deleted by other users without administrative
 * privileges. The operation does not return any response body as per standard
 * practice for DELETE operations, with success indicated by a 204 No Content
 * response.
 *
 * Related API operations include retrieving a specific post (GET
 * /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}), updating a post (PUT
 * /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}), and retrieving all comments for a
 * post (PATCH /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}/comments). This 'erase'
 * operation is the primary method for post removal in the UI.
 *
 * Note: The communitybbs_post table in the schema has no soft-delete
 * capability, so there is no deleted_at field. Deletion removes all associated
 * data permanently.
