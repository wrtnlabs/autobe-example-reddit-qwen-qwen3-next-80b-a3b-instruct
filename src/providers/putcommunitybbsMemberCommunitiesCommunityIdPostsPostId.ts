   * Update an existing post by ID
   *
   * This operation updates an existing post within a community. It operates on the communitybbs_post table from the Prisma schema. The post can only be updated by its original author. Updates are subject to content length restrictions as defined in business requirements (title: 5-120 characters, body: 10-10,000 characters). This endpoint enables users to correct content or improve posts after submission.
   *
   * Security considerations mandate that only the original author of a post can modify it. The system enforces ownership verification through the communitybbs_member_id relationship. If a user attempts to update a post they did not author, the system returns a forbidden response with the message 'You can edit or delete only items you authored.' This protection prevents unauthorized modification of others' content.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the communitybbs_post table as defined in the Prisma schema. The request payload includes the updated title and body content. The response returns the updated post entity including its updated_at timestamp, which is automatically set by the service layer. The updated_at field ensures clients receive the latest update information for optimal UI consistency.
   *
   * Validation rules strictly enforce the content length requirements: titles must be at least 5 characters long and no more than 120 characters; bodies must be at least 10 characters long and no more than 10,000 characters. The system also validates that the post exists, belongs to the specified community, and that the user is the author. If the content violates these constraints, the system returns a 400 Bad Request error with appropriate messages such as 'Title must be between 5 and 120 characters.' or 'Body must be between 10 and 10,000 characters.'
   *
   * Related API operations include retrieving a specific post (GET /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}), creating new posts (POST /communities/{communityId}/posts), and deleting posts (DELETE /communities/{communityId}/posts/{postId}). This 'update' operation is the primary method for post editing in the UI.
   *
   * Note: The system does not include a deleted_at field in the communitybbs_post table, so there is no soft-delete capability. The edit operation directly modifies the post data without preservation of previous versions.
