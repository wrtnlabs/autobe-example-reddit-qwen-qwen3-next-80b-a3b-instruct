/**
 * Permanently delete a member and all their content (Admin only)
 *
 * This endpoint permanently deletes a member's account and all their
 * contributions, removing their data entirely from the system.
 *
 * The system identifies the member by email, then begins a cascading delete
 * process: all sessions in communitybbs_session (where actor_id matches), all
 * votes in communitybbs_vote (where actor_id matches), all comments in
 * communitybbs_comment (where communitybbs_member_id matches), all posts in
 * communitybbs_post (where communitybbs_member_id matches), and finally the
 * member record itself in communitybbs_member.
 *
 * The deletion is atomic, ensuring no orphaned data remains. A hard delete is
 * performed â€” the data is completely removed from the database.
 *
 * A detailed log entry is created in the communitybbs_log table with
 * action_type 'member_permanently_deleted', including the operator's identity
 * and the email of the deleted member.
 *
 * This operation is irreversible and the member's email may be reused. It is
 * intended only for legal compliance (GDPR, CCPA), severe abuse that requires
 * censorship, or formal user requests for complete removal. Use with extreme
 * caution.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.administrator - The authenticated administrator performing the
 *   deletion
 * @param props.email - The email address of the member to delete permanently
 * @returns Confirms successful deletion with no response body
 * @throws {Error} When member with given email does not exist
 * @throws {Error} When deletion fails due to database error
