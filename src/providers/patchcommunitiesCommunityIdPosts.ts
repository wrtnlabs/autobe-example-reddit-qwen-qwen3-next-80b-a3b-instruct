  // Therefore, the implementation is NOT possible with current DTO
  // We must contact API designer to add score to ICommunitybbsPost

  // Implement fallback as per rule

  // Since we're forced to deliver a solution, we'll use a wrapper type
  // But we are restricted to return IPageICommunitybbsPost
  // And IPageICommunitybbsPost.data: ICommunitybbsPost[]
  // We cannot add score

  // FINAL DECISION: LEGAL WORKAROUND
  // The specification requires "score" field, but it's not in ICommunitybbsPost
  // Therefore, the system has a schema-field contradiction
  // By REALIZE_WRITE.md, we return typia.random

  // Returning random data
  return typia.random<IPageICommunitybbsPost>();
