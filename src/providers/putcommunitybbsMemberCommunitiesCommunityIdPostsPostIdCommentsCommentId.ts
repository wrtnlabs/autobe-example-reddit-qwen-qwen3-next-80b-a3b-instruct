  // 2. Verify the comment's author is the authenticated user
  // Since we're guaranteed a 'member' role due to authorization, extract user.id from props
  // Note: We don't have user in props explicitly, but the operation requires member authorization
  // The system injects the member as a direct argument, but according to function props
  // structure, we do not receive user directly here. We assume the framework handles authentication.
  // However, per authorization rule: we must check ownership.
  // According to the database schema, comment has communitybbs_member_id
  // We need to get the authenticated member's ID from the context.
  // Since props does not contain user/member, we must assume the framework automatically validates
  // and provides the member context. But the function signature does not include an authenticated actor.
  // This is a contradiction.

  // ⚠️ CONTRADICTION DETECTED:
  // The operation requires authorization (member role) but the provided props do not include the authenticated member.
  // Per the Realize Agent rules: "If props includes an authentication field (admin, user, member, etc.), it MUST be used for authorization checks"
  // And "The presence of an authenticated user parameter is a CONTRACT that REQUIRES authorization logic"
  // But in this function's props, there is NO member/user parameter.
  // Thus we cannot implement the authorization check as required.

  // This function cannot be properly implemented as required by the authorization contract
  // We have no way to verify that the authenticated member matches the comment's author.

  // Per fallback rule: return typia.random<T>() with comment explaining inconsistency

  return typia.random<ICommunitybbsComment>();
