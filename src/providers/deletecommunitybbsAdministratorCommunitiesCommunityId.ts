/**
 * Permanently delete a community by ID
 *
 * This operation permanently removes a community and all its associated content
 * from the platform. It is exclusively available to administrators and triggers
 * a cascading deletion of all related data. When a community is deleted, all
 * posts, comments, votes, and search index entries associated with the
 * community are also removed from the database. This operation performs a hard
 * delete, meaning the community record is permanently removed from the database
 * and cannot be recovered. It is not a soft delete because, although the
 * communitybbs_community model has a deleted_at field, this field is used for
 * archival reporting and UI filtering only â€” the system does not preserve
 * records after deletion; instead, log entries are maintained for audit
 * purposes. This behavior is consistent with the requirement that
 * administrators can delete communities and purge all associated data. The
 * deletion is atomic and must succeed or fail entirely, ensuring no orphaned
 * records remain. The system will also log the deletion event in the
 * communitybbs_log table for audit trail purposes. This operation requires
 * elevated permissions because it irreversibly removes user-generated content
 * and metadata. Access is restricted to the administrator role with no fallback
 * to other roles for security and compliance reasons.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.administrator - The authenticated administrator performing the

 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the community does not exist
 * @throws {Error} When the authenticated administrator is not valid
