/**
 * Delete a userâ€™s own post.
 *
 * This operation permanently removes a post authored by the authenticated
 * member. Uses the communitybbs_post table, where it updates the deleted_at
 * field to mark the post as deleted (soft delete). This behavior is determined
 * by the presence of the deleted_at column in the Prisma schema, which exists
 * for soft deletion capability. The operation is only permitted if the
 * member_id matches the post's communitybbs_member_id. Authorization is
 * role-based to the member who created the post.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.member - The authenticated member making the deletion request
 * @param props.postId - The unique identifier of the post to be deleted. Must
 *   be an existing record in communitybbs_post.id and authored by the member.
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the post does not exist (404)
 * @throws {Error} When the authenticated member is not the author of the post
