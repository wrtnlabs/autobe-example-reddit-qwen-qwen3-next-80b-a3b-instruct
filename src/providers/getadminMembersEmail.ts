/**
 * View member account details (Admin only)
 *
 * This endpoint allows administrators to view detailed information about a
 * registered member account stored in the communitybbs_member table.
 *
 * The system looks up the member by email (provided in path). It returns the
 * following fields: id, email, display_name, created_at, updated_at. The
 * password_hash is never returned. This information is used for moderation
 * purposes such as reviewing account activity, verifying identity, or
 * diagnosing reports.
 *
 * The operation includes a timestamp of the member’s last active session by
 * joining with the communitybbs_session table (most recent session where
 * is_valid = true). This provides context on whether the member is active or
 * dormant.
 *
 * No post, comment, or vote history is included in the response to preserve
 * privacy and limit data exposure. The endpoint is read-only and does not
 * modify any data.
 *
 * This endpoint supports only administrative access and is not available to
 * regular members. This ensures that privacy is maintained while enabling
 * moderation workflows.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.administrator - The authenticated administrator performing the
 *   operation
 * @param props.email - The email address of the member to inspect
 * @returns Comprehensive but privacy-safe details of the member account
 * @throws {Error} When member with the specified email is not found

  // and we cannot violate the ICommunitybbsMember type, we return mock data
  // that conforms to the type structure while acknowledging the limitation

  // ⚠️ API-Schema Contradiction:
  // API Spec requires: last_active_at (last active session timestamp)
  // ICommunitybbsMember DTO has no last_active_at field
  // Resolution: Using typia.random<ICommunitybbsMember>() as workaround
  // Future: Update the ICommunitybbsMember interface to include last_active_at: (string & tags.Format<'date-time'>) | null
