/**
 * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of communities
 *
 * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of communities from the system. This
 * operation provides advanced search capabilities for finding communities based
 * on multiple criteria including partial name matching, description keyword
 * search, category filtering, and activity-based sorting.
 *
 * The operation supports comprehensive pagination with configurable page sizes
 * and multiple sort orders including 'Name Match' (default for community
 * search) and 'Recently Created'. Communities can be sorted by name similarity
 * to the search query, creation date, or popularity metrics derived from member
 * count and last active timestamp.
 *
 * Security considerations include rate limiting for search operations and
 * appropriate filtering of sensitive community information based on the
 * requesting user's authorization level. Only users with appropriate
 * permissions can access detailed community information, while basic community
 * lists may be available to authenticated users.
 *
 * This operation integrates with the communitybbs_community table as defined in
 * the Prisma schema, incorporating all available community fields including
 * name, description, category, logo, banner, rules, member_count, and
 * last_active_at. The response includes community summary information optimized
 * for list displays, with options to include additional details based on
 * authorization level. The search functionality leverages the
 * communitybbs_search_community table for optimized full-text performance
 * across name and description fields.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.body - Search criteria and pagination parameters for community
 *   filtering
 * @returns Paginated list of community summary information matching search
 *   criteria
 * @throws {Error} When search term is invalid (not enforced, handled by schema)
