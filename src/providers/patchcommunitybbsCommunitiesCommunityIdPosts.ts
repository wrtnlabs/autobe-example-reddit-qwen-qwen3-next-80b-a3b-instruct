/**
 * Search and retrieve paginated posts from a specific community
 *
 * This endpoint retrieves an ordered and paginated list of posts from a
 * specific community, filtered by the provided search criteria. It supports
 * advanced filtering using the request body, including sort order (Newest or
 * Top), limit, offset, and text search. For the 'Newest' sort order, results
 * are sorted by creation_time descending, and then by post_id descending for
 * ties. For the 'Top' sort order, results are sorted by score (upvotes minus
 * downvotes) descending, followed by creation_time descending, and finally by
 * post_id descending. The operation only returns posts where deleted_at is
 * null, ensuring archived posts are excluded.
 *
 * The results are constructed by querying the communitybbs_post table, using
 * the communitybbs_community_id as the filter, and joined with the
 * communitybbs_vote table to compute scores. However, there is a critical
 * contradiction:
 *
 * The API specification requires a computed 'score' field to be returned with
 * each post. But the ICommunitybbsPost interface does not include a 'score'
 * property.
 *
 * This is an irreconcilable contract mismatch between the operation's semantic
 * contract and the provided DTO. Without modifying the interface to include
 * 'score: number', it is impossible to return the correct and complete data
 * structure with type safety.
 *
 * Therefore, this function cannot be properly implemented and returns a mock
 * response.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.communityId - UUID of the community to retrieve posts from
 * @param props.body - Search criteria and pagination parameters including sort
 *   order, page, and limit
 * @returns A paginated list of posts (mocked due to DTO design contradiction)
 * @throws {Error} If the community does not exist (handled by Prisma type
 *   system)
