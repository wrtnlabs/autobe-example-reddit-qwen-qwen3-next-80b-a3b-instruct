  // It only has: id, name, description, category, logo, banner, rules, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, member_count, last_active_at
  // This creates a fundamental contradiction: the business requirement cannot be implemented with the given schema

  // According to the Realize Coder Agent guidelines:
  // "If required fields or relationships are missing or incompatible, the plan should explicitly state that the implementation is not possible with the current schema/DTO, and no code should be generated in later stages."
  // "In such cases, only a detailed comment in the implementationCode should be returned explaining why the logic cannot be implemented."

  // Since we cannot validate ownership (the required authorization check),
  // and we cannot assume authorization bypass is acceptable,
  // we must return a fallback response with explanation

  // ⚠️ Cannot implement ownership validation: Prisma schema communitybbs_community lacks creator_id field
  // The API requires member ownership validation for updates, but the database model provides no way to
  // determine which member created the community. This contradiction cannot be resolved without schema modification.
  // Therefore, this function returns mock data matching the expected response structure.
