/**
 * Create a new post in a specified community.
 *
 * This operation requires the user to be authenticated as a member and to
 * submit a valid title and body. The title must be between 5 and 120 characters
 * and the body between 10 and 10,000 characters, as per requirements. The body
 * content must be plain text only, with no HTML, scripts, or code allowed. The
 * author's display name is captured at the time of submission and stored as
 * part of the post for consistency, even if the member later changes their
 * display name. If no display name is provided, the system defaults to
 * 'Anonymous'. The new post is associated with the given community via the
 * communityId path parameter and the authenticated member's ID. Upon successful
 * creation, the community's last_active_at timestamp is updated to the current
 * time, and the post count is incremented internally. The post is immediately
 * available in the community feed and is indexed in the search system. This
 * operation does not require soft delete handling during submission because the
 * post is created in active state only; soft deletion is a permissioned
 * moderation action handled separately. The post is created as a direct
 * user-initiated action, not a system-generated record, and must be trackable
 * to the user who submitted it. This endpoint is protected â€” guests cannot
 * create posts and will be redirected to login. Only the member role has
 * permission to invoke this endpoint.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.communityId - Unique identifier of the community to which the
 *   post will be added
 * @param props.body - Creation data for a new post, including title, body, and
 *   optional display name
 * @returns Created post object with id, title, body, author, created_at, and
 *   score. Score is calculated as the sum of upvotes minus downvotes, initially
 *   zero.
 * @throws {Error} When community does not exist or is deleted
 * @throws {Error} When user is not authenticated
